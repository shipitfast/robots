"""Expose a real robot on ROS 2 over pure RTPS - no rclpy, no sourced distro.

This is the rclpy-free twin of examples/ros2/hardware_bridge_demo.py. Same
full-duplex behavior - publish /<robot>/joint_states (+ camera image_raw),
subscribe /<robot>/joint_command -> send_action - but the transport is pure
cyclonedds (a single pip wheel) instead of rclpy, so it runs with NO sourced
ROS 2 distro:

    pip install "strands-robots[ros2]"   # pulls cyclonedds; nothing else needed
                                         # on macOS / Windows / Linux x86_64.
                                         # Linux aarch64 (Jetson) has no
                                         # cyclonedds wheel and needs a Cyclone
                                         # DDS C install (CYCLONEDDS_HOME) - see
                                         # docs/rtps-integration.md

The two transports emit byte-identical topics, so a real ROS 2 node, rviz, or
the stock `ros2` CLI cannot tell this apart from the rclpy bridge or a real
hardware node:

    ros2 topic echo /so101/joint_states
    ros2 topic pub --once /so101/joint_command sensor_msgs/msg/JointState \
      '{name: ["shoulder_pan.pos"], position: [0.1]}'

Type coverage is bounded by the RTPS IDL bundle (strands_robots.rtps.idl):
joint_states + image_raw are in; anything outside the bundle needs the rclpy
backend (ros2_transport="rclpy", the default).

A physical SO-101 must be connected; with no arm attached this raises at
connect() - the bridge itself is hardware-agnostic.
