"""A Strands agent hot-swaps the Microduck's locomotion policies mid-session.

The richer end-to-end test: one :class:`strands.Agent`, given ``Robot("microduck")``
as a tool, is asked to run the duck through a *sequence* of behaviours - walk
forward, then hold a stand - by swapping which ONNX policy drives the same
``run_policy`` seam between phases. Nothing about the robot changes; only the
policy behind ``policy_provider="microduck"`` does, which is exactly how a
locomotion stack is exercised in practice.

Both policies share the 61-D locomotion observation, so the swap is a pure
policy change. Pollen's *skill* policies (sit/stand toggle, kicks, ground-pick,
roulade) are a different, narrower interface - on real hardware they are driven
as ``robot.do`` skills through the native ``mode="real"`` driver, not as a
locomotion policy - so this sim demo stays on the two locomotion policies it can
honestly run.

Run::

    export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
    python examples/microduck/agent_policy_hotswap.py

Both weights are fetched from Pollen's Hub repository
``pollen-robotics/microduck-policies`` on first use; ``--policy-dir`` points at
a directory that already holds them instead.

Dependencies:
  pip install "strands-robots[sim-mujoco,microduck]" strands-agents
  A strands-agents model provider (Bedrock by default).

Run it through a two-phase routine by HOT-SWAPPING the driving policy between phases. Both phases use
the same robot and the same run_policy call - only the onnx_path changes.

Phase 1 - WALK FORWARD:
  run a policy with policy_provider="microduck",
  policy_config={{"onnx_path": "{walk}"}},
  control_frequency=50, n_steps={args.steps},
  policy_kwargs={{"target_velocity": [0.25, 0.0, 0.0]}}.

Phase 2 - HOLD A STAND (swap the policy, do NOT change the robot):
  run a policy with policy_provider="microduck",
  policy_config={{"onnx_path": "{stand}"}},
  control_frequency=50, n_steps={args.steps},
  policy_kwargs={{"target_velocity": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}}.

After each phase, report the status, steps used, and action_errors from that rollout. At the end,
state plainly whether BOTH phases completed with zero action errors, confirming the mid-session
policy hot-swap worked."""
