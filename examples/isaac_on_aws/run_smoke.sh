#   * The SSM parameter document below is EXECUTED AS ROOT on the instance under

#     can pre-create it as a symlink - so the `>` redirect clobbers whatever the

#     `aws ssm send-command` read, which is arbitrary command injection into that
#     channel (CWE-377).
#   * That document embeds the presigned S3 URL, a one-hour bearer credential to
#     the whole packed source tree. Left at a default-umask path it outlived the
#     run world-readable.
#
# `mktemp -d` creates the directory 0700, so neither is reachable. It also fixes
# the shape the tarball used: `$(mktemp ...).tgz` appends a suffix to the name
# mktemp RESERVED, so the file actually written is a different, unreserved path -
# the same race more weakly - and the reserved one was then leaked.

# --expected-bucket-owner on BOTH S3 legs, because the bucket name is derived from
# the account id and the region and is therefore PREDICTABLE, while S3 bucket names
# are one global namespace. Account ids are not secrets - they appear in ARNs, in
# error messages and in shared CloudTrail - so a stranger can pre-create this exact
# name and attach a policy granting the operator access. A bare `head-bucket` then
# answers 200 for a bucket THEY own, and the rest of this pipeline proceeds into it:
#
#   * the upload hands over the whole packed working tree, uncommitted changes and
#     all;
#   * the presigned URL embedded in the staging document points into their bucket,
#     and root on the instance curls it, untars it into /opt/strands and executes
#     the inner.sh it contains inside the GPU container.

# the s3api operations (HeadBucket, PutObject, GetObject) and does not exist on the
# high-level `s3` commands. `create-bucket` does not model it and needs it least: it
# fails outright when the name is taken.

# The download leg needs no flag of its own. Both legs above establish that the
# bucket is ours, and a bucket `s3 mb` just created is private, so no third party
# can substitute the object between the upload and the instance's fetch.

#
# Either way add_robot then refuses for a file that is merely absent
