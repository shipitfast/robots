"""Join the fleet mesh with a real Unitree G1 via the native CycloneDDS driver.

The G1 does not speak the lerobot serial bus; it speaks raw Unitree IDL over
CycloneDDS - a bus lerobot's driver cannot reach. This example wires the
native driver into the mesh: ``Robot("g1", mode="real", driver="strands", ...)``
returns :class:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1.G1Driver`, and ``Mesh(...)`` wraps
it so the fleet dashboard's presence card, IMU chip, battery chip and lidar
summary appear the moment the driver's DDS callbacks deliver their first
messages.

Dependencies (on the robot's control PC): ``pip install
"strands-robots[mesh]" cyclonedds unitree_sdk2py``. The SDK is lazy-imported by
the driver, so ``strands_robots`` remains importable on a machine without it -
that is what makes every headless test pass.

Runtime: keeps running until Ctrl-C. The DDS subscribers deliver at ~1 kHz
(low-state), 10 Hz (lidar) and 1-2 Hz (battery); the mesh pacer decides what
to publish and at what rate.

Hardware note: **this example only makes sense against a real G1**. On Thor,
in CI or on any laptop without CycloneDDS on the same LAN as the robot, the
DDS init fails with a named reason and the driver stays in the
"usable but not connected" state. That is deliberate - a mesh peer that never
connects is still a valid peer, so ``Mesh(...)`` publishes an "offline" card
instead of raising.
