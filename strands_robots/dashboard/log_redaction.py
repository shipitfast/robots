    """Redacts every part of a record a formatter renders, and redacts it once.

    ``logging.Formatter.format`` renders THREE parts and appends the last two: the
    message, ``exc_text`` (rendered from ``exc_info``), and ``stack_info``. Both are
    appended AFTER every filter has run, so a filter that reads ``getMessage()`` alone
    never sees them - and an exception message is exactly where a request URL ends up,
    so ``logger.exception(...)`` wrote the credential verbatim into the traceback while
    the request line above it was redacted. ``exc_info`` is rendered here instead of
    later because the formatter reuses an ``exc_text`` that is already set.

    A formatter may also render ``args`` DIRECTLY rather than through ``getMessage()``,
    and uvicorn's own ``AccessFormatter`` does: it unpacks five values out of
    ``record.args`` and builds the request line from them, never reading the message this
    filter had cleaned. Baking the redacted text into ``msg`` and clearing ``args`` - the
    stock way to freeze a redacted message - therefore left that formatter nothing to
    unpack, and it raised ``ValueError`` inside ``Handler.emit`` for exactly the records
    carrying a credential: the access log kept every ordinary request and dropped every
    authenticated socket handshake, which is the audit trail this module exists to keep
    readable. So the args are redacted in place and their arity preserved, and the message
    is baked only when the credential is not visible in any single arg - the case where no
    per-arg redaction could reach it, and where failing closed is the right answer.

    Redacting is idempotent per record because :func:`install_redaction` attaches this
    filter at BOTH the logger and its handlers (a handler-level filter is what catches
    records logged straight to a handler). Without the marker the handler pass redacted
    the logger pass's OUTPUT: a fingerprint's own text matches the value pattern, so the
    line printed a wrong length - ``?token=<redacted:18:aco>>`` for a 43-character token,
    the same corruption the literals-last rail order exists to prevent.

    An appended part this filter cannot render or redact is WITHHELD, not raised: a
    ``Formatter`` runs inside ``Handler.emit``, where ``handleError`` degrades a broken
    record to a note on stderr, and a filter has no such guard - so an escape here would
    come out of the caller's own logging call, on any logger in :data:`_TARGETS`.
