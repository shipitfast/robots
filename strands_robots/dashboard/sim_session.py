"""A simulated robot stepping in this process, owned by one thread.

``SimSession`` wraps the engine ``Robot(name, mode="sim")`` returns. One worker
thread creates the engine, steps it in real time, renders frames and applies
queued commands; every other thread reads an immutable snapshot. This is not a
style choice: the renderer's GL context is bound to the thread that made it, and
MuJoCo's ``MjData`` is not safe to step and read from two threads at once.

Freezing is the e-stop. A frozen session stops stepping but keeps rendering
and keeps answering telemetry, so an operator sees the robot exactly where it
stopped. A queued command that would move the robot is refused when the worker
reaches it rather than applied - the refusal is that command's own result, so
the caller is told, never silently dropped. A command the worker was already
inside when the freeze landed cannot be recalled: that write completes, and the
route answers the request 423 with the lockout still latched.

A session can also be a MIRROR: given a ``source`` (see
:mod:`strands_robots.dashboard.mirror`), the worker never steps physics. Each
tick it takes the source's joint angles, writes them into ``qpos`` and runs
the kinematics, so the render and the twin show the real arm where it is. A
mirror refuses ``set_joints`` and ``reset`` - the arm decides the pose - and a
source that stops answering, or a pose the model refuses, shows as ``stale`` or
``error`` with the reason rather than as a frozen pose reported as healthy.

Nothing here knows about the mesh, hardware, or HTTP.
