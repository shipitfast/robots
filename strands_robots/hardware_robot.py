Universal Robot Control with Policy Abstraction for Any VLA Provider

This module provides a clean robot interface that works with any LeRobot-compatible
robot and any VLA provider through the Policy abstraction.

Features:
- Async robot task execution with real-time status reporting
- Non-blocking operations - robot moves while tool returns status
- Stop functionality to interrupt running tasks
- Connection state management with proper error handling
- Policy abstraction for any VLA provider

Operator approval: this class is the ``mode="real"`` half of
:func:`strands_robots.Robot`, so every ``execute`` or ``start`` the agent tool
dispatches drives real actuators. Both stop for a human BEFORE the rollout is
dispatched, through the same decision path the ROS transports and the serial
tool use (:func:`~strands_robots._command_gate.gate_motion`):
``STRANDS_ROBOT_COMMAND_ALLOW`` (comma-separated ``execute``/``start``, or
``*``) pre-approves, ``BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true`` lifts the gate with a WARNING,
otherwise the operator is asked through the agent's interrupt and, with no
agent reachable, the call is refused and nothing is dispatched. The dashboard's
:class:`~strands_robots.dashboard.agent_hitl.MotionInterruptHook` may already
have asked; a grant it deposited for this exact call is spent instead of asking
twice. ``status`` and ``stop`` are never gated - stopping must not get harder -
and the simulation tool is a different class that never touches hardware.
Before this gate the README's first path to metal, ``Agent(tools=[Robot("so100",
mode="real")])``, dispatched unasked while the same robot commanded through
``robot_mesh`` was gated (F-011, CWE-862).

# Lazy lerobot RobotConfig registration helper.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# lerobot's robot drivers register themselves with ``RobotConfig`` (a
# draccus ``ChoiceRegistry``) via ``@RobotConfig.register_subclass(...)``
# at module import time. Because ``lerobot.robots.__init__`` does not
# eagerly import every subpackage, the registry is empty until something
# triggers the import. ``_create_minimal_config`` calls this helper once
# per process to populate it. ``@functools.cache`` makes the second call
# a dict lookup, so the per-Robot() overhead amortises to ~0.


# Cross-robot kwargs forwarded to lerobot config constructors.  Exposed
# as a module-level constant so tests can import it (single source of
# truth).
#
# Post-R5, the dual-gate semantics are:
#   - kwargs in this allowlist BUT NOT on the resolved target dataclass
#     are silently dropped (cross-robot polymorphism: passing ``kp=...``
#     to so101 doesn't blow up just because ``kp`` is a unitree_g1
#     kwarg).
#   - kwargs declared on the resolved target dataclass are forwarded
#     automatically, regardless of whether they appear in this list
#     (so a future lerobot field like ``wifi_ssid`` Just Works without
#     a strands_robots release).
#   - kwargs unknown to BOTH are rejected at config-build time
#     (typos like ``prot=``, kwargs from another subsystem entirely).
#
# So this allowlist's job is narrow: it's the set of kwargs whose
# silent-drop on a non-matching robot we tolerate as a documented
# polymorphism win.  It is not a forwarding gate -- ``valid_fields``
# is.
_FORWARDABLE_KWARGS = (
    "port",  # serial robots (so100/so101, koch, openarm, ...)

# Per-camera config construction.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``Robot(..., cameras={"front": {...}})`` describes each camera with a
# free-form dict. That dict is a serialized lerobot ``CameraConfig``: ``type``
# is draccus' own choice discriminator (``CameraConfig.type`` returns
# ``get_choice_name(cls)``) and every other key is a field of the dataclass that
# discriminator selects. So both halves of the vocabulary are derived, never
# hand-picked:
#
#   - the set of accepted ``type`` values is ``CameraConfig.get_known_choices()``
#     -- the same draccus ``ChoiceRegistry`` lookup ``_create_minimal_config``
#     already uses for ``robot_type``, and the one ``make_cameras_from_configs``
#     dispatches on. A camera backend lerobot ships or a vendor plugin registers
#     is therefore attachable the day it lands, with no mapping to maintain here.
#   - the set of accepted option keys is ``dataclasses.fields()`` of the
#     resolved class. A hand-picked list leaves every field it forgets
#     unreachable (no caller can set it at all) and silently discards every key
#     it does not recognise, so a typo like ``heigth=1080`` reports success
#     having configured the default resolution.
#
# ``strands_robots`` supplies its own defaults for the three fields lerobot
# leaves as ``None`` (meaning "whatever the device negotiates") so an
# unconfigured camera has a predictable, documented stream. Those three are
# declared on the ``CameraConfig`` base, so they are fields of every registered
# choice and the defaults apply to a RealSense exactly as they do to a webcam.
# Every other field keeps lerobot's own default.
#
# Invariant: every key here must be a field lerobot still declares. If one is
# renamed upstream the stale key reaches the config constructor and fails
# loudly for every camera rather than being silently dropped -- and the test
# suite asserts the containment directly, so the drift is caught before a
# release rather than at an operator's ``Robot()`` call.

    """Validate and normalize the ``max_relative_target`` servo safety clamp.

    ``max_relative_target`` caps how far each commanded goal position may move
    from the joint's present position. It is the only per-command travel limit
    on the hardware path, so a value the driver cannot honor is a safety defect
    rather than a cosmetic one - and lerobot's own consumer,
    ``lerobot.robots.utils.ensure_safe_goal_position``, honors a narrower set of
    values than the config dataclass accepts:

    - a non-finite limit disables the clamp with no signal. ``min(diff, nan)``
      and ``max(diff, -nan)`` both return ``diff`` unchanged, so the caller
      believes travel is limited while every goal is applied in full.
    - a negative limit inverts it. ``min(diff, -c)`` then ``max(..., c)``
      resolves to ``present + c`` for any requested goal, turning the clamp
      into a fixed-magnitude step generator that ignores the policy.
    - a zero limit discards every commanded motion, so the rollout is a no-op
      reported as success - the same outcome the rollout horizon guards refuse
      for ``duration`` and ``control_substeps``.
    - an ``int`` limit is refused outright at the first servo command, with a
      bare ``TypeError(10)`` naming neither the parameter nor the reason: that
      consumer dispatches on ``isinstance(value, float)``, while both the
      dataclass field (annotated ``float | dict[str, float] | None``) and PEP
      484's numeric tower accept an ``int``. So the one spelling a type checker
      is happiest with is the one that cannot reach the motors.

    Normalizing to ``float`` is therefore load-bearing, not cosmetic: it is what
    lets a type-correct ``max_relative_target=10`` reach the bus at all.

    Per-motor mapping values are held to the same domain. Their KEYS are not
    checked here - the motor names are known only once the bus is connected, so
    a mismatch is left to the driver's own ``keys must match`` refusal.

    Args:
        value: The caller-supplied limit: ``None`` to leave the clamp disabled,
            a positive finite number, or a mapping of motor name to one.
        robot_type: The lerobot robot type, named in the error so a fleet
            reports which arm was misconfigured.

    Returns:
        ``None`` unchanged, or the limit with every magnitude coerced to
        ``float``.

            action_horizon: Actions consumed from each inferred policy chunk
                before re-querying. Must be a positive integer - it is a lower
                bound on the chunk slice the task loop applies

            data_config: Data configuration (for GR00T compatibility)
            control_frequency: Control loop frequency in Hz (default: 50Hz).
                Must be a positive finite number - it is the divisor of the
                loop's per-action period (``1 / control_frequency``), the only
                throttle between two servo commands. A ``0``, negative,
                ``nan`` or ``inf`` rate raises ``ValueError`` here rather than
                leaving the loop unthrottled against real hardware.
            ros2_bridge: When True, publish this robot's live observation
                (``joint_states`` + one ``image_raw`` per camera) on a ROS 2
                domain so external ROS 2 nodes can subscribe to the physical
                robot, and the agent's own ``use_ros`` calls reach the same
                graph. The symmetric counterpart of ``SimEngine(ros2_bridge=...)``
                for real hardware. Requires ``rclpy`` (system ROS 2 / the
                official docker image); an ImportError is raised here if it is
                missing. Defaults to False - the robot never touches ROS 2,
                so disabling the bridge is simply the default (opt-in).
            ros2_domain: ROS 2 domain id (``ROS_DOMAIN_ID``) to publish on.
                Only an ``int`` in ``[0, 232]`` names a domain: RTPS derives its
                discovery ports from it, and 233 lands past the end of the port space.
            ros2_commands: When True (default), the bridge also subscribes to
                ``/<robot>/joint_command`` and forwards inbound messages to
                ``send_action`` so an external ROS 2 stack can drive the real
                arm (full duplex). Set False for a read-only telemetry bridge.
                Ignored unless ``ros2_bridge=True``. Only a boolean names a
                posture: the value is checked, not read by truthiness, so
                ``"false"`` cannot open the surface it asks to close.
            ros2_transport: Which ROS 2 backend the bridge uses:
                ``"rclpy"`` (default) - full ``sensor_msgs`` fidelity, needs a
                sourced ROS 2 distro; ``"rtps"`` - pure cyclonedds (a single
                pip wheel, no rclpy / no sourced distro), type coverage bounded
                by the local IDL bundle (joint_states + image_raw). Both emit
                byte-identical topics. Ignored unless ``ros2_bridge=True``.
            joint_limits: Optional ``{"<motor>.pos": (min, max)}`` clamp ranges
                threaded into the ROS 2 bridge, keyed by the joint name as it
                arrives on the wire (the same ``<motor>.pos`` names the bridge
                publishes in ``joint_states``). When set, an inbound
                ``joint_command``
                whose ANY joint is outside its declared range is rejected whole
                (no partial application). Requires ``ros2_bridge=True``.
            dds_security_config: Optional DDS Security credentials
                (``identity_ca``, ``certificate``, ``private_key``,
                ``governance``, ``permissions``; ``permissions_ca`` optional,
                each a non-empty string) for the pure-RTPS bridge. When ``ros2_commands=True`` on the
                ``"rtps"`` transport this (or the
                ``STRANDS_ROS2_BRIDGE_I_KNOW_THIS_IS_INSECURE=1`` opt-out) is
                REQUIRED - the bridge refuses to drive the arm over an unsecured
                DDS graph. Only the ``"rtps"`` transport consumes it (rclpy DDS
                Security is configured via the ROS 2 RMW keystore/env); passing
                it with ``ros2_transport="rclpy"`` raises. Requires

        Plain method (not part of an ``__init__`` contract) so the lightweight
        test doubles that build a ``Robot`` via ``__new__`` need not thread it
        through. When ``ros2_bridge`` is True, the selected bridge is created
        eagerly so a missing backend dependency fails fast at construction
        rather than mid-task. The bridge is bound to ``self`` so that, with
        ``ros2_commands=True``, inbound ``/<robot>/joint_command`` messages are
        forwarded to ``self.send_action`` - full duplex, the real arm both
        publishes telemetry and is drivable from the ROS 2 graph.

        Two transports, byte-identical on the wire:

        * ``"rclpy"`` (default) - :class:`~strands_robots.hardware_ros_bridge.HardwareRosBridge`,
          full ``sensor_msgs`` fidelity, needs a sourced ROS 2 distro.
        * ``"rtps"`` - :class:`~strands_robots.hardware_rtps_bridge.HardwareRtpsBridge`,
          pure cyclonedds (a pip wheel, no rclpy / no sourced distro), type
          coverage bounded by the local IDL bundle.

        Args:
            ros2_bridge: Enable the ROS 2 bridge for this robot.
            ros2_domain: ROS 2 / DDS domain id to publish on.
                Only an ``int`` in ``[0, 232]`` names a domain: RTPS derives its
                discovery ports from it, and 233 lands past the end of the port space.
            ros2_commands: When True (default), also subscribe to
                ``joint_command`` and drive the arm; False for read-only. Only a
                boolean names a posture: the value is checked, not read by
                truthiness, so ``"false"`` cannot open the surface it asks to
                close.
            ros2_transport: ``"rclpy"`` or ``"rtps"`` (see above).
            joint_limits: Optional ``{"<motor>.pos": (min, max)}`` clamp ranges
                threaded into whichever bridge is built (both enforce them on
                inbound commands via the shared base), keyed by the joint name
                as it arrives on the wire.
            dds_security_config: Optional DDS Security credentials, consumed
                only by the ``"rtps"`` bridge. Passing it with the ``"rclpy"``

        """Create a minimal lerobot RobotConfig for ``robot_type``.

        Uses lerobot's draccus ``ChoiceRegistry`` to resolve the registered
        config subclass. This is the same lookup ``make_robot_from_config``
        performs internally and means we automatically support every robot
        lerobot ships (so100/so101, koch, openarm, unitree_g1, aloha, ...)
        without maintaining a hand-rolled mapping.

        Robot-specific kwargs (``port``, ``robot_ip``, ``kp``, ``kd``,
        ``default_positions``, ``calibration_dir``, ``mock``, ``use_degrees``,
        ``is_simulation``, ``control_dt``, ``gravity_compensation``,
        ``controller``, ``max_relative_target``, ``disable_torque_on_disconnect``)
        are forwarded if and only if the resolved config dataclass declares
        a matching field. This means kwargs that exist in the union-of-
        robots allowlist but not on the current robot's dataclass are
        dropped silently -- that is the deliberate cross-robot
        polymorphism (``Robot('so101', kp=[...])`` won't fail just because
        ``kp`` is a unitree_g1 thing).

        A kwarg that is NOT in the allowlist at all is rejected with
        ``ValueError`` rather than dropped, per AGENTS.md > Review
        Learnings (#86) > "Reject silently-dropped kwargs". This catches
        typos like ``prot=`` (instead of ``port=``) at config-build time
        rather than as a delayed connection failure with no kwarg in
        sight.

        The mirror-image mistake -- a required field that no forwarded kwarg
        supplied -- is refused here too, naming the parameter the caller
        supplies rather than letting the dataclass report
        ``SOFollowerRobotConfig.__init__() missing 1 required positional
        argument: 'port'``. A missing port additionally names this host's
        servo-bus candidates and their USB serial numbers, because a port path
        is a position on the bus while the serial number is what survives a
        replug -- see :func:`strands_robots._serial_discovery.scan_serial_devices`.
        The scan answers a missing ``port`` only: naming serial devices for a
        missing ``remote_ip`` would point a network robot's caller at the wrong
        bus entirely.

        Each entry of ``cameras`` follows the same contract twice over: its
        ``type`` is resolved against lerobot's ``CameraConfig`` choice registry
        and its remaining keys against the fields of the class that resolves to
        -- see :func:`_build_camera_config`.

        Forwarded values are otherwise passed through as given, because their
        accepted domains are robot-specific. ``max_relative_target`` is the
        exception: it is the per-command servo travel limit, and the driver
        honors a narrower domain than the dataclass accepts, so it is validated
        and normalized here -- see :func:`_normalize_max_relative_target`.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If a kwarg is unknown to both the cross-robot allowlist
                and the resolved dataclass, if a ``cameras`` entry is malformed,
                if ``max_relative_target`` is not a limit the driver can honor,
                if the resolved dataclass declares a required field that no
                forwarded kwarg supplied, or if the resolved config class
                refuses the assembled values.
            TypeError: If lerobot resolves ``robot_type`` to a non-dataclass
                config class, which would make kwarg filtering unsafe.

        recover, because it is gated on ``is_connected``
        (``bus.is_connected and all(cam.is_connected ...)``):

        - **A failed connect.** lerobot's ``MotorsBus.connect()`` opens the

          (e.g. an unpowered bus) leaves ``is_connected`` True while
          fire-and-forget writes to the dead bus keep "succeeding". A robot's
          ``connect()`` then opens its cameras one at a time
          (``for cam in self.cameras.values(): cam.connect()``) with no
          cleanup of its own, so a camera that fails to open leaves every
          camera ahead of it in the set still streaming. Either leak makes the
          *next* attempt unrecoverable rather than merely failing: the retry
          raises ``DeviceAlreadyConnectedError`` on a device that is perfectly
          healthy, which masks the device that actually failed.
        - **Teardown.** ``cleanup()`` prefers the driver's own ``disconnect()``
          while the robot is fully connected, and falls back here when it is
          not -- or when that disconnect raised partway and abandoned the
          devices behind it.

        Each device is closed independently: one close that raises must
        neither mask the caller's original error nor stop the remaining

        the open bus alone reads as connected.

        The three steps are one critical section under ``bus_lock(self.robot)``
        because the observe actions are ungated by design, so an agent or a

        A ``start_mono`` of ``0.0`` means no task has begun (it is the

        lists the keywords a caller must supply, so it judges a *missing* port -
        ``cosmos3`` dials a server yet defaults its port, so it is absent there
        and a caller may legally omit one. ``config_keys`` lists the keywords the
        provider understands, so it judges a *supplied* port: a provider outside
        that set is handed a keyword it never declared, which
        :func:`~strands_robots.registry.policies.provider_reads_a_port` reports.

        ``None`` is the "not supplied" spelling and is refused here for the same
        reason it is refused in :meth:`_get_policy`: without a pre-built
        ``policy_object`` there is nothing to build a policy from. Every other
        value is checked against
        :func:`~strands_robots.utils.tcp_port_error`, the shared domain whose
        docstring already names "the policy providers that dial one (``groot``,
        ``moveit2``, ``cosmos3``, ``lerobot_async``)" - the very
        providers this path forwards to - so the same port cannot be accepted by
        the arm's task entry points and refused by the provider they hand it to.

        That domain also names the value the caller supplied. A supplied-but-
        unusable ``0`` / ``False`` used to be reported as
        ``"policy_port is required for robot operation"``: falsy, so

        ``_shutdown_event`` is one of the control loop's exit conditions
        (``not self._shutdown_event.is_set()``), so once ``cleanup()`` has set
        it the loop body can never execute. Nothing checked it on the way in,
        though, so a task started afterwards ran the whole bring-up and then
        fell out of the loop on its first evaluation - the same shape as the
        unusable ``duration`` that :meth:`_duration_error` refuses, and it
        reported the same false ``completed``.

        Bring-up is not free of side effects, which is what makes this a
        refusal rather than a cosmetic status fix. Measured on a two-device arm
        after ``cleanup()``:

        - ``_connect_robot()`` re-opens the motors bus and warms every camera,
          and ``cleanup()`` does not disconnect the robot, so the re-opened
          devices stay open for the life of the process. The executor is
          already shut down, so no later ``cleanup()`` can close them either.
        - ``Policy.reset()`` is called, clearing the per-episode state (action
          chunk cache, sampler RNG, KV-cache) of a policy object the caller may
          still be driving elsewhere - the documented
          ``run_policy(policy_object=...)`` reuse pattern.
        - The policy is never queried and the arm is never commanded, yet
          ``run_policy`` and the agent-tool ``execute`` action both returned
          ``status="success"`` with ``steps: 0``, indistinguishable from a
          rollout that really ran.

        ``start_task`` did not report success - it raised
        ``RuntimeError("cannot schedule new futures after shutdown")`` from the
        executor submit, naming an executor internal rather than the robot. The
        guard makes all three entry points refuse in the same tool shape, per
        this module's contract that an action handler returns an error dict

            policy_port: Port of the policy server to query. Required when
                ``policy_provider`` dials one: this entry point takes no
                pre-built policy, so the port is the only thing a policy can be
                built from. A provider that builds in process declares no port,
                and supplying one anyway is refused rather than forwarded and
                dropped. Validated on the shared
                :func:`~strands_robots.utils.tcp_port_error` domain before the
                task is submitted, so a port no policy can be built from is
                reported here instead of as a started task that connects the
                arm and then fails on the executor thread.
            policy_host: Host of the policy server.
            policy_provider: Provider name used to build the policy.
            duration: Wall-clock budget in seconds. Must be positive and
                finite; it is validated before the task is submitted, so a
                budget the loop cannot honor is reported here instead of as a
                started task that commands nothing (or never ends).
            **policy_kwargs: Checkpoint/provider keywords (``model_path``,
                ``policy_type``, ``pretrained_name_or_path``,
                ``server_address``, ...) forwarded to ``create_policy`` via
                :meth:`_get_policy`. This is the vocabulary the mesh dispatch
                collects from the wire command; per-provider validity is
                ``create_policy``'s contract, so an unknown keyword is the
                provider's own refusal to make.

        Returns:
            Tool-shaped result confirming the task started, or an error naming
            the offending parameter. A second task is refused while another
            rollout is in flight - including during its connect/policy-build
            bring-up - because the arm has a single command bus. A robot that
            ``cleanup`` / ``stop`` has shut down is refused permanently: the
            executor and bridges are gone, so a rollout started now would
            command the arm zero times.

        Hardware counterpart of ``Simulation.run_policy(policy_object=...)``:
        drive a policy already constructed in-process (e.g. via
        ``create_policy(...)`` around a local checkpoint) without standing up
        a policy server on a port. Reuses the exact ``start_task`` control
        loop - connect (with half-open rollback), state-key initialization,
        the RTC control-frequency / observed-delay contract, and
        ``resolve_chunk_length`` chunk consumption - so a pre-built object
        and a server-backed provider behave identically on the wire.

        Blocking: returns when ``duration`` elapses, after ``n_steps``
        applied actions, or when ``stop_task()`` is called from another
        thread. For the server-backed provider path (and for fire-and-forget
        execution) use ``start_task``.

        Exclusive: the arm has a single command bus, so this is refused while
        another rollout is in flight - including while that rollout is still
        connecting or building its policy, before it reports ``RUNNING``.
        Two rollouts admitted at once would interleave ``send_action`` writes
        on one half-duplex bus and share the single task-state slot.

        Terminal after shutdown: ``cleanup`` / ``stop`` release the task
        executor, the mesh and the ROS bridges and cannot be undone, so a
        rollout requested afterwards is refused rather than admitted to command
        the arm zero times. A rollout already running when the shutdown lands is
        reported ``STOPPED`` - a shutdown truncates a task exactly as
        ``stop_task`` does, so its step count is a partial one.

        Args:
            policy_object: A constructed ``Policy`` instance. The object's
                own device / embodiment / chunking configuration is honored;
                the loop only injects the robot state keys and the RTC
                control rate, exactly as it does for server-backed policies.
                Its per-episode state is cleared via ``Policy.reset`` at the
                start of every task, so one object can be reused across tasks
                without the previous task's cached action chunk being driven.
            instruction: Natural-language instruction passed to the policy on
                every ``get_actions`` call.
            duration: Wall-clock budget in seconds (same default as
                ``start_task``). Must be positive and finite; the loop bounds
                the rollout by it even when ``n_steps`` is given, so a value it
                cannot honor is refused rather than reported as a rollout that
                commanded nothing.
            n_steps: Optional cap on applied actions (mirrors the sim
                ``run_policy`` parameter); the loop stops at whichever of
                ``duration`` / ``n_steps`` comes first. ``None`` (the
                default) requests no cap and leaves ``duration`` the sole
                horizon. Any other value must be a positive integer, the
                domain the sim horizon and this loop's ``action_horizon``
                already share: the loop bounds the rollout by
                ``step_count < n_steps``, so a cap it cannot count against
                is refused rather than spent on the arm.

        The device is connected lazily, on the first task, so for most of a
        robot's life an agent asks about it while nothing is open. What can be
        read then: the port it was built for and whether that path exists on
        this host, the cameras it was configured with, and the ``is_connected``
        flag. What cannot: ``is_calibrated`` - lerobot reads it through the
        bus and raises ``DeviceNotConnectedError`` before ``connect()`` - so
        it is ``None`` until the device is connected, rather than a raise that
        turned the whole :meth:`get_status` probe into its error shape for
        every idle arm.

        Every fact here is three-state for the same reason: ``True``/``False``
        is a reading, ``None`` is "this was not readable" - including
        ``is_connected``, which is a probe and not a stored flag. Every shipped
        lerobot arm folds its cameras into it (``self.bus.is_connected and
        all(cam.is_connected for cam in self.cameras.values())``, 8 drivers in
        lerobot 0.6.2), so the camera whose probe raises - the one this method
        already tolerates per-camera below - arrives through that aggregate
        first. Read unguarded it took the whole probe down with it: the port, a
        filesystem read that cannot raise, was discarded too, and
        :meth:`get_status` answered ``is_connected: False`` for an arm that was
        connected and driving.

        A port is not always a device path - lerobot's network drivers carry a
        TCP port (``Reachy2RobotConfig.port`` is ``50065``, reached at its
        ``ip_address``), and there is nothing on this host to stat for one, so

        An ``AgentTool`` receives no ``tool_context`` argument; the SDK builds
        one from the invoking agent for decorated tools, and this builds the
        same object from the same two inputs so the shared gate can raise the
        same interrupt. With no agent in ``invocation_state`` (a direct call,
        a headless script) there is no operator to ask and the gate refuses.

        Args:
            action: ``"execute"`` or ``"start"``.
            tool_input: The tool's input dict, shown to the operator and used to
                match a dashboard grant.
            tool_use: The tool-use request carrying ``toolUseId``.
            invocation_state: The agent runtime's kwargs; ``"agent"`` when the
                call came through an :class:`strands.Agent`.

        Returns:
            A refusal message, or None to let the dispatch proceed.

        Raises:
            InterruptException: When the operator has not answered yet; the
                caller turns it into a ``ToolInterruptEvent`` exactly as the
                SDK does for a decorated tool.

        Two fields answer different questions about cameras, and the pair is
        what makes an unhealthy device attributable:

        * ``cameras`` enumerates the camera names the device is *configured*
          for - which image streams exist at all.
        * ``cameras_connected`` maps each live camera to its own
          ``is_connected`` reading - which of those streams are actually up.

        ``is_connected`` on a lerobot arm is ``bus and all(cameras)``, so a
        single dropped camera pulls it to ``False`` without naming which of the
        N+1 facts fell. Reported beside the per-camera readings, a ``False``
        becomes attributable: a camera reading ``False`` is the culprit, and
        every camera reading ``True`` leaves the motor bus as the one by
        elimination.

        Best-effort per camera, mirroring the observation path: a camera whose
        ``is_connected`` probe raises is omitted from ``cameras_connected``
        rather than failing the whole probe, so a name present in ``cameras``
        and absent from ``cameras_connected`` is one whose state could not be
        read. That same raise also reaches the arm's aggregate ``is_connected``,
        which reports ``None`` for it rather than degrading this probe to its
        error shape - so the attribution survives the failure it exists to
        attribute. A device exposing no live camera objects reports an empty map.

        Returns:
            Status dict of measured facts. An unexpected failure anywhere in
