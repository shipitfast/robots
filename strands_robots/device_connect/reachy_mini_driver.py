    in :meth:`ZenohLink.send_cmd` -- and nothing downstream narrows it. Two
    unusable shapes reach the wire from there, and they fail in opposite
    directions:

    * Zenoh reads ``*`` and ``**`` as key-expression wildcards, and accepts
      them on a *publisher* key as readily as on a subscriber one. So a
      wildcard prefix widens ``<prefix>/command`` from one robot's inbox into a
      match-any key: a single :meth:`ReachyMiniDriver.look` is delivered to
      every Reachy Mini subscribed beneath the pattern, and the reciprocal
      subscriptions fold every robot's joint and IMU frames into the one
      driver's ``_latest_joints`` / ``_latest_imu``. Nothing reports this --
      the widened call succeeds.
    * The shapes Zenoh refuses outright (an empty segment, a stray ``?``) are
      not refused here either. They surface from inside the transport at
      :meth:`ZenohLink.start`, after :meth:`ReachyMiniDriver.connect` has
      already probed the daemon and logged a connection, rather than from the
      constructor call that named them.

    So the accepted domain is "a ``/``-joined sequence of mesh identifiers":
    each segment goes through the shared
    :func:`~strands_robots.mesh.security.validate_mesh_identifier`, whose own
    docstring gives the reason -- it exists because an unvalidated key-
    expression segment "silently widens a point-to-point subscription into a
    match-any one". A multi-segment prefix stays legitimate, so namespacing two
    Minis apart as ``reachy_mini/robot_a`` and ``reachy_mini/robot_b`` is
    unaffected; it is the wildcard that is refused, not the ``/``.

def _motion_domain_error(rpc_name: str, values: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, str] | None:
    """Structured rejection when a motion argument cannot reach the robot.

    Every value in *values* is a signed physical quantity -- an angle in degrees
    or an offset in millimetres -- that the movement RPCs carry verbatim into a
    command dict and hand to the active :class:`HardwareLink`. Both links put
    that dict on the wire as JSON, and Python's encoder emits ``nan`` / ``inf``
    as the bare tokens ``NaN`` / ``Infinity``, which RFC 8259 does not define.
    So a non-finite argument is not refused by the transport: it produces a
    frame the daemon must either reject whole -- losing the command with the
    call already reported as ``success`` -- or parse leniently, handing a
    non-finite target to the servos.

    Shared by all three movement RPCs so their accepted domain cannot diverge:
    :meth:`ReachyMiniDriver.look` alone carries six of these values, and before
    this helper the same unusable argument behaved differently depending on
    which one it landed in -- an ``inf`` angle raised ``ValueError: math domain
    error`` out of the RPC from ``math.cos``, while an ``inf`` offset was
    divided by 1000 and reported as a successful move.

    Two bounds, in this order. Finiteness and numeric-ness first, via the shared
    :func:`~strands_robots.utils.finite_number_error`; both signs and zero are
    legitimate there (a negative pitch looks down, zero re-centres). Then every
    parameter that names a bounded joint is held to the shared travel envelope,
    :func:`~strands_robots.tools.reachy.envelope_error`, through
    :data:`_ENVELOPE_AXIS_BY_PARAM`.

    That second bound used to be excused as the daemon's to enforce, on the
    grounds that it depends on hardware this library does not model. That was
    true when this helper was written and is no longer: the library models the
    envelope. :data:`~strands_robots.tools.reachy.MOTION_ENVELOPE_DEG` gives
    every bounded axis its travel in degrees, in a package whose own purpose
    statement is "what the *two* Reachy consumers must agree on and neither
    owns: the motion envelope", and which is importable with no Reachy and no
    daemon attached. The other of those two consumers,
    :meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.reachy.ReachyDriver.send_action`, already
    consults it. So a head pitch of 200 degrees on a +/-40 degree axis was
    refused by one driver and carried to the wire as 3.49 radians by the other,
    for the same physical robot, and this RPC reported ``success``.

    Finiteness is asked first for two reasons: an unusable value is then named
    by the caller's own parameter spelling rather than by the axis it maps to,
    and a travel comparison against ``nan`` is meaningless - ``abs(nan) <= 40``
    is ``False``, so an unordered value would be refused with a message about
    travel. That is the same ordering :func:`envelope_error` documents for its
    own checks.

    The head-body yaw coupling limit the envelope also carries is not reachable
    from here: it bounds ``head_yaw - body_yaw``, and this surface splits the
    pair across :meth:`ReachyMiniDriver.look` and :meth:`ReachyMiniDriver.body`,
    so neither RPC ever holds both. Per-axis travel is the half that transfers.

    That is a scope and not a delegation. The other half needs the head yaw the
    daemon is targeting while a lone ``body`` turn is carried out;
    :meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.reachy.ReachyDriver.send_action` has that,
    because it records the head pose it last sent, and so applies the coupling
    to a body-only turn as well as to a pair. This driver keeps no such record,
    so a ``body`` RPC here is per-axis only. Keeping no record is the invariant:
    were one added, the limit would become reachable and this exclusion would
    have to go with it.

    Args:
        rpc_name: The RPC that received the values, used as the message prefix.
        values: Parameter name to caller-supplied value, in signature order.

    Returns:
        The rejection dict for the first unusable value, or ``None`` when every
        value can be honored.

        The refusal is an envelope rather than the ``RuntimeError``

        ``move_name`` - is already an envelope, and a remote caller branches on
        ``status``.

        Presence rather than truthiness decides, because an HTTP error with an
        empty body puts ``""`` under ``error``. A reply that is not a mapping is
