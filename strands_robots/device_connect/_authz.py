"""Caller-authorization helpers for Device Connect robot/sim drivers.

Security hardening: Device Connect RPC handlers run on the device side with no
built-in per-call authorization. State-mutating RPCs (execute / stop / step /
reset) and lifecycle events (emergencyStop) must therefore verify the calling
device against an operator-controlled allowlist before acting on physical (or
simulated) hardware.

Allowlists are sourced from environment variables so deployments opt in without
code changes:

* ``DEVICE_CONNECT_RPC_ALLOW`` - comma-separated device ids permitted to call
  state-mutating RPCs. **Unset means nobody**: with no allowlist every
  state-mutating RPC is refused, and the refusal is logged once naming the
  variable to set. ``*`` means "allow all" and logs a warning so the permissive
  posture is visible - it is the development spelling, and it has to be typed.
  An empty value is treated as unset, and a value is empty when it holds no
  non-blank entry after stripping - so ``""``, ``" "`` and ``","`` are all
  unset. (Before F-003 an unset allowlist meant "allow all": a device that was
  simply never configured executed every peer's ``execute`` / ``stop`` /
  ``step`` / ``reset``, and the warning was the only sign.)
* ``DEVICE_CONNECT_ESTOP_ALLOW`` - comma-separated device ids permitted to
  trigger emergency-stop handling. Falls back to ``DEVICE_CONNECT_RPC_ALLOW``
  when unset. With neither set, a **named** caller may still stop the robot -
  stopping must never get harder than moving - but an anonymous caller
  (``caller=None``) is refused, so the fallback stays permissive for peers that
  say who they are and the warning still fires.

Matching supports trailing ``*`` glob prefixes (e.g. ``safety-*``).

Caller-identity semantics (READ THIS before relying on the allowlist):

* The caller id is whatever the messaging layer reported as the RPC's
  ``source_device``. A device-to-device caller (another ``DeviceRuntime``) and
  an agent that sets ``STRANDS_ROBOT_MESH_AGENT_ID`` both carry an id; an
  anonymous client carries **none** (``caller=None``).
* When an allowlist IS set, a missing/None caller cannot be authorized and is
  denied (fail-closed). So setting ``DEVICE_CONNECT_RPC_ALLOW`` will reject
  every anonymous caller - configure an id on the caller side to allow it.
* The id is only as trustworthy as the transport. Under authenticated
  transport (mTLS) it is bound to the sender's certificate. Under insecure
  transport it is **self-asserted** - any peer can claim any id - so the
  allowlist is advisory there, not a cryptographic boundary. A one-time warning
  is logged in that case.
* Which of those two holds is a property of the ``DeviceRuntime`` the driver is
  attached to, not of the environment alone. A runtime resolves its posture from
  its own ``allow_insecure`` argument first and ``DEVICE_CONNECT_ALLOW_INSECURE``
  second, so this module reads the runtime's resolved answer and falls back to
  the variable only when no runtime is attached. Reading the variable
  unconditionally answered the lower-precedence half of the question: a runtime
  brought up with ``allow_insecure=True`` and the variable unset is insecure and
  went unwarned, and one brought up with ``allow_insecure=False`` while the
  variable opted in is authenticated and was warned about anyway.

    Read through ``getattr`` with a default rather than as ``driver._device``
