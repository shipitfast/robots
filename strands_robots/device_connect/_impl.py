"""Private implementation of the ``device_connect_edge``-backed entry points.

Split out of ``strands_robots.device_connect.__init__`` so importing the
package does not import ``device_connect_edge``. The package's ``__getattr__``
imports this module the first time a caller asks for one of the three symbols
it re-exports (``init_device_connect``, ``init_device_connect_sync``,
``resolve_allow_insecure``), so a stock ``pip install strands-robots`` reaches
those names only when it also brings the extra that supplies them.

``resolve_allow_insecure`` is pure Python and could live in a stdlib-only
module. It stays here so the behavioural pin travels with the two entry points
it guards -- one import path per public name. The string vocabulary it parses is
owned by the stdlib-only sibling ``_authz``, which needs the same answer for its
own fallback and cannot import this module (that would drag
``device_connect_edge`` into a module the native Reachy driver loads), so the
constant lives there and both readers import it. The tests exercise it through
``strands_robots.device_connect.resolve_allow_insecure`` rather than reaching
into this private module, so pushing the module load a level deeper does not
change what the suite grades.

    """Resolve the effective ``allow_insecure`` setting (secure by default).

    Precedence: explicit arg > ``DEVICE_CONNECT_ALLOW_INSECURE`` env var >
    secure default (``False``). Insecure transport is never implicit - it
    must be opted into via the argument or the env var.

    Extracted as a pure function so the secure-by-default posture is unit
    testable without standing up a DeviceRuntime.

    The two sources carry the same setting in different shapes, and each is held
    to its own declared type rather than to the other's. An environment variable
    is a string by construction, so *env_value* is **parsed**: only
    ``("true", "1", "yes")`` opt in and every other spelling is secure. The
    argument is declared ``bool | None``, so it is **checked**: a non-boolean is
    refused rather than parsed with that same vocabulary.

    Checking the argument is what keeps the two sources from disagreeing about
    one value. A non-empty string is truthy, so returning the argument as given
    made ``resolve_allow_insecure("false")`` enable insecure transport while
    ``DEVICE_CONNECT_ALLOW_INSECURE=false`` disabled it: every falsy spelling
    inverted, and only on the path documented here as the higher precedence.
    Parsing the argument with the environment vocabulary instead would move
    which spellings invert rather than remove the inversion - ``"on"``,
    ``"enabled"`` and ``"y"`` are absent from that vocabulary, so each would
    silently resolve to secure while reading as an opt-in.

    Args:
        explicit: The caller's setting, or ``None`` to fall through to the
            environment variable. Must be a python or numpy boolean when given.
        env_value: The raw ``DEVICE_CONNECT_ALLOW_INSECURE`` value, or ``None``
            when it is unset.

    Returns:
        Whether insecure transport is enabled, always as a real ``bool`` - so a
        numpy boolean from a caller's own comparison satisfies the annotation
        and the identity assertions the runtime's setting is pinned with.
