"""``strands-robots verify-dataset`` - validate a recorded LeRobot dataset.

Detects the "mega-episode" corruption class: a collection run that intended to
record N distinct episodes but instead buffered every frame into a single
``episode_index=0`` episode (or whose ``meta/info.json`` count drifted from the
on-disk parquet). The parquet under ``meta/episodes/**/*.parquet`` is the ground
truth; this never trusts an agent's narration ("recorded 20/20") or in-memory
recorder bookkeeping.

Checks performed against a dataset root (the dir containing ``meta/``):
  1. parquet exists and holds at least one distinct episode;
  2. every episode has at least ``--min-frames`` frames (default 1) - flags any
     zero-length episode (``--min-frames 0`` disables this one check);
  3. ``meta/info.json`` ``total_episodes`` / ``total_frames`` (when present)
     agree with the parquet ground truth - flags metadata/parquet drift;
  4. when ``--expected N`` is given, the parquet holds exactly N episodes -
     flags the "wanted N, got M" mismatch.
  5. every per-episode video file referenced by the dataset (one MP4 per
     camera per episode, resolved from ``meta/info.json``'s ``video_path``
     template and the episode parquet's ``videos/<key>/chunk_index`` /
     ``file_index`` columns) exists on disk, is non-empty, and - when its
     frame count can be read from the container header - holds exactly the
     number of frames the parquet maps into it (the sum of the ``length`` of
     every episode packed into that file). Flags the video-modality sibling
     of mega-episode corruption: a correct episode count but missing pixels,
     whether the file is absent/empty or a truncated/partial encode with
     fewer frames than recorded (disable with ``--no-check-videos``).
  6. no ``action`` / ``observation.state`` column is identically zero across
     a multi-frame episode - the dead-control-column corruption (correct
     counts and pixels, but the proprioceptive/action signal was written as
     all zeros), read from the per-episode stats (disable with
     ``--no-check-stats``). A multi-robot recording is graded per robot, using
     the per-robot column names it declares: one robot's whole block of
     columns written as zeros is flagged even while another robot's columns
     carry real measurements.

Usage:
    strands-robots verify-dataset /path/to/dataset
    strands-robots verify-dataset /path/to/dataset --expected 20
    python -m strands_robots verify-dataset ~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/user/ds

A corrupt ``meta/episodes`` parquet is itself reported rather than raised: each
unreadable file is named as a problem and the remaining checks still run against
the readable files, so partial corruption (one truncated file out of twenty)
localises the damage instead of collapsing the whole report to "0 episodes".

Exit code is 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise - so it drops straight into
CI as a dataset-integrity gate.

def read_dataset_episode_indices(root: str | Path) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Read episode-level ground truth from a LeRobot v3 dataset on disk.

    Parses every ``meta/episodes/**/*.parquet`` file under ``root`` and returns
    the recorded episode index set plus per-episode frame counts. This is the
    parquet source of truth used by :meth:`~strands_robots.simulation.base.SimEngine.verify_dataset_episodes`
    to confirm a recording session produced the number of distinct episodes the
    caller intended (rather than one merged ``episode_index=0`` mega-episode).

    Pure ``pyarrow`` read - it does NOT import ``lerobot`` or instantiate a
    ``LeRobotDataset`` (which would re-validate/scan the whole dataset). Reads
    only the lightweight episode metadata parquet.

    Args:
        root: Dataset root directory (the dir that contains ``meta/``).

    Returns:
        Dict with:
          - ``episode_indices``: sorted list of distinct ``episode_index`` values.
          - ``total_episodes``: number of distinct episodes (``len`` of above).
          - ``total_frames``: sum of per-episode ``length`` (0 if unavailable).
            A dataset whose episodes all recorded 0 frames also sums to 0, so
            read ``frames_per_episode`` to tell "no lengths" from "no frames".
          - ``frames_per_episode``: per-episode frame counts aligned to
            ``episode_indices``. Empty when no episode carried a usable
            ``length`` (the column is absent, or every value is null); a
            recorded ``0`` is a frame count and is reported as one.
          - ``info_total_episodes``: the ``total_episodes`` recorded in
            ``meta/info.json`` (``None`` if that file is absent or unreadable, or
            if it declares no usable count - see ``info_problems``). Returned
            alongside the parquet truth so callers can cross-check the two
            metadata sources for agreement - a healthy dataset has
            ``info_total_episodes == total_episodes``.
          - ``info_problems``: one message per ``meta/info.json`` declaration
            that is present but is not a count (empty list for a healthy
            dataset). A cross-check must fail on these rather than read the
            ``None`` count as an absent header, which is agreement.
          - ``unreadable_files``: ``"<path relative to root>: <error>"`` for
            every ``meta/episodes`` parquet that could not be read (empty list
            for a healthy dataset). A partially-corrupt dataset - one truncated
            file out of twenty, the usual outcome of an interrupted sync or hub
            download - still yields the episode truth of the readable files, so
            callers can localise the damage instead of seeing zero episodes.
            The episode counts above cover ONLY the readable files, so any
            non-empty ``unreadable_files`` means the totals are a lower bound
            and the dataset must not be certified as complete.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If ``pyarrow`` is not installed.
        FileNotFoundError: If no ``meta/episodes`` parquet exists under ``root``
            (no episode was ever flushed - the dataset is empty/unfinalized).
        ValueError: If every ``meta/episodes`` parquet is unreadable, so there

    LeRobot v3 writes per-episode feature statistics inline in
    ``meta/episodes/**/*.parquet`` (``stats/<feature>/min`` / ``.../max`` /
    ``.../count`` ...). A recording whose ``action`` (or ``observation.state``)
    column is identically zero across an entire multi-frame episode passes every
    count, length and video check yet carries no usable control signal -- the
    proprioceptive sibling of the mega-episode and missing-video corruption
    classes. This happens when a writer's action keys never resolve to the
    declared columns (so every frame's action is written as zeros) while the
    episode and frame counts stay correct.

    For each control feature (``action`` and any ``observation.state*``) that
    carries per-episode ``min``/``max`` stats, flag every episode with at least
    two frames whose feature vector is identically zero (every component
    ``min == max == 0``). Single-frame episodes are skipped: a lone frame has
    ``min == max`` trivially, so all-zero there is not yet evidence of a dead
    column. Reading only the lightweight stats columns keeps this
    decoder-independent (no video decode, no ``data/`` scan).

    A multi-robot recording needs the same check one level finer. It declares one
    state/action column per robot per joint, so when the writer's keys resolve for
    one robot and not another only that robot's block is written as zeros - the
    vector as a whole still varies, and a whole-vector test cannot see it.
    ``_declared_column_blocks`` recovers each robot's own columns from the
    per-robot names in ``declared_features``, and a block that is wholly zero is
    reported the same way a wholly-zero vector is. A zero subset of a block is
    left alone: a gripper parked at zero for a whole episode is a measurement,
    not a writer fault. With no usable declaration this is exactly the
