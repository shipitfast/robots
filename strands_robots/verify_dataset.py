"""``strands-robots verify-dataset`` - validate a recorded LeRobot dataset.

Detects the "mega-episode" corruption class: a collection run that intended to
record N distinct episodes but instead buffered every frame into a single
``episode_index=0`` episode (or whose ``meta/info.json`` count drifted from the
on-disk parquet). The parquet under ``meta/episodes/**/*.parquet`` is the ground
truth; this never trusts an agent's narration ("recorded 20/20") or in-memory
recorder bookkeeping.

Checks performed against a dataset root (the dir containing ``meta/``):
  1. parquet exists and holds at least one distinct episode;
  2. every episode has at least ``--min-frames`` frames (default 1) - flags any
     zero-length episode (``--min-frames 0`` disables this one check);
  3. ``meta/info.json`` ``total_episodes`` / ``total_frames`` (when present)
     agree with the parquet ground truth - flags metadata/parquet drift, a
     header that declares something which is not a count, and a file that
     holds no JSON object at all (a partially-synced or foreign document
     carries no headers to compare, and is reported as corrupt metadata);
  4. when ``--expected N`` is given, the parquet holds exactly N episodes -
     flags the "wanted N, got M" mismatch.
  5. every per-episode video file referenced by the dataset (one MP4 per
     camera per episode, resolved from ``meta/info.json``'s ``video_path``
     template and the episode parquet's ``videos/<key>/chunk_index`` /
     ``file_index`` columns) exists on disk, is non-empty, and - when its
     frame count can be read from the container header - holds exactly the
     number of frames the parquet maps into it (the sum of the ``length`` of
     every episode packed into that file). Flags the video-modality sibling
     of mega-episode corruption: a correct episode count but missing pixels,
     whether the file is absent/empty or a truncated/partial encode with
     fewer frames than recorded (disable with ``--no-check-videos``).
  6. no ``action`` / ``observation.state`` column is identically zero across
     a multi-frame episode - the dead-control-column corruption (correct
     counts and pixels, but the proprioceptive/action signal was written as
     all zeros), read from the per-episode stats (disable with
     ``--no-check-stats``). A multi-robot recording is graded per robot, using
     the per-robot column names it declares: one robot's whole block of
     columns written as zeros is flagged even while another robot's columns
     carry real measurements.

Usage:
    strands-robots verify-dataset /path/to/dataset
    strands-robots verify-dataset /path/to/dataset --expected 20
    python -m strands_robots verify-dataset ~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/user/ds

A corrupt ``meta/episodes`` parquet is itself reported rather than raised: each
unreadable file is named as a problem and the remaining checks still run against
the readable files, so partial corruption (one truncated file out of twenty)
localises the damage instead of collapsing the whole report to "0 episodes". The
same holds for ``meta/info.json``, whether it cannot be read or holds a document
that is not a JSON object.

Exit code is 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise - so it drops straight into
CI as a dataset-integrity gate.

    """The mapping ``meta/info.json`` holds, and the problem when it holds none.

    One owner for reading this file, because both readers here need the same
    three-way answer and each grades it once: the drift check REPORTS an
    unusable file (that is the corruption it exists to find), and the video
    check discards the problem so one broken header is not reported twice.

    A document that parses but is not a JSON object carries no headers at all -
    the same "nothing to verify against" as a file that cannot be read, and the
    same partially-synced / foreign-file damage. It is answered here rather than
    used as a mapping, because ``.get`` on a list, a string or ``null`` raises
    ``AttributeError``: a type no reader of this file names, so it escaped
    ``verify_dataset`` as a traceback and took the whole report with it - every
    problem already found included - on exactly the corruption being looked for.
    ``strands_robots.tools.run_policy`` already grades the parsed document this
    way for its own envelope; this is the same verdict at the checker.

    "Unreadable" is ``ValueError`` and not the narrower ``json.JSONDecodeError``
    because reading this file has more ways to fail than holding something that
    is not JSON: bytes the declared encoding does not describe raise
    ``UnicodeDecodeError``, and a number longer than
    ``sys.get_int_max_str_digits`` raises a plain ``ValueError``.

    """Flag dead (identically-zero) control columns via per-episode stats.

    LeRobot v3 writes per-episode feature statistics inline in
    ``meta/episodes/**/*.parquet`` (``stats/<feature>/min`` / ``.../max`` /
    ``.../count`` ...). A recording whose ``action`` (or ``observation.state``)
    column is identically zero across an entire multi-frame episode passes every
    count, length and video check yet carries no usable control signal -- the
    proprioceptive sibling of the mega-episode and missing-video corruption
    classes. This happens when a writer's action keys never resolve to the
    declared columns (so every frame's action is written as zeros) while the
    episode and frame counts stay correct.

    For each control feature (``action`` and any ``observation.state*``) that
    carries per-episode ``min``/``max`` stats, flag every episode with at least
    two frames whose feature vector is identically zero (every component
    ``min == max == 0``). Single-frame episodes are skipped: a lone frame has
    ``min == max`` trivially, so all-zero there is not yet evidence of a dead
    column. Reading only the lightweight stats columns keeps this
    decoder-independent (no video decode, no ``data/`` scan).

    A multi-robot recording needs the same check one level finer. It declares one
    state/action column per robot per joint, so when the writer's keys resolve for
    one robot and not another only that robot's block is written as zeros - the
    vector as a whole still varies, and a whole-vector test cannot see it.
    ``_declared_column_blocks`` recovers each robot's own columns from the
    per-robot names in ``declared_features``, and a block that is wholly zero is
    reported the same way a wholly-zero vector is. A zero subset of a block is
    left alone: a gripper parked at zero for a whole episode is a measurement,
    not a writer fault. With no usable declaration this is exactly the
    whole-vector rule, so a dataset that declares no names is graded as before.

    Args:
        root_path: Dataset root directory (the dir that contains ``meta/``).
        known_unreadable: Episode-parquet paths (relative to ``root_path``) the
            caller has already reported as unreadable. They are skipped without
            a second problem string, so one broken shard is reported once.
        declared_features: The ``features`` mapping from ``meta/info.json``,
            whose per-feature ``names`` carry the per-robot column prefixes.
            Read only to split a partially-dead vector into blocks; ``None``
            (or anything that is not a mapping) keeps the whole-vector rule.

    Returns:
        A ``(checked, problems)`` tuple where ``checked`` is the number of
        per-episode control-feature stat vectors inspected and ``problems``
        lists the dead-column episodes (empty when the dataset carries no stats
        or every control column varies).
