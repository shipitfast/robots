"""Shared rclpy publisher for robot telemetry on a ROS 2 domain.

Both the simulation bridge (:class:`strands_robots.simulation.ros_bridge.SimRosBridge`)
and the hardware bridge (:class:`strands_robots.hardware_ros_bridge.HardwareRosBridge`)
advertise the same per-robot topics so a real arm and its digital twin look
identical on the ROS 2 graph:

* ``/<robot>/joint_states`` (``sensor_msgs/msg/JointState``) - joint names and
  positions.
* ``/<robot>/<camera>/image_raw`` (``sensor_msgs/msg/Image``, ``rgb8``) - one
  message per camera frame.

The ROS 2 *wire contract* - topic names, name sanitization, and inbound
``joint_command`` parsing - lives in the transport-agnostic
:class:`RosTelemetryBase`, so the rclpy and pure-RTPS
(:class:`strands_robots.hardware_rtps_bridge.HardwareRtpsBridge`) transports
are byte-identical on the graph by construction, not by two independent
codepaths happening to agree. :class:`RosTelemetryBridge` adds the rclpy
machinery on top - node ownership, per-robot publisher caching, and message
construction - so the sim and hardware bridges are thin, symmetric subclasses
that differ only in their default node name. ``rclpy`` and the ROS 2 message
packages are optional, system-provided dependencies (they are not on PyPI);
they are imported lazily through
:func:`strands_robots.utils.require_optional`, so importing this module - and
running with the bridge disabled - never requires ROS 2.

def _qos_history_depth_error(value: Any, param: str, context: str) -> str | None:
    """Error text when ``value`` is not a usable KEEP_LAST history depth.

    The depth is handed to ``create_publisher`` / ``create_subscription`` as the
    ``qos_or_depth`` argument, which rclpy turns into
    ``QoSProfile(depth=value, history=KEEP_LAST)``. It is the one bridge
    parameter whose consumer is not reached from the constructor: the publishers
    are built lazily, on the first ``publish_joint_states`` / ``publish_image``
    for a robot, so an unusable depth is a construction that reports success and
    a telemetry stream that fails - or silently is not the one asked for - later,
    on the first frame.

    Two failure modes, both measured against rclpy on ROS 2 Jazzy:

    * ``0`` is **accepted**. rclpy warns "A zero depth with KEEP_LAST doesn't
      make sense; no data could be stored. This will be interpreted as
      SYSTEM_DEFAULT" and builds the publisher with the middleware default, so
      the caller's declared depth is silently not the depth in force - and
      ``warnings.warn`` shows once per location, so a second bridge in the same
      process says nothing at all. ``False`` is that same value arriving by
      another route, and ``True`` is a silent depth of 1 - one frame of history
      on a stream the caller asked to buffer.
    * every other spelling raises from *inside* rclpy, naming no parameter:
      ``-1`` gives ``ValueError: history depth must be greater than or equal to
      zero``, a float / ``str`` / ``None`` / ``nan`` / ``inf`` gives
      ``TypeError: Expected QoSProfile or int``, and so does ``np.int64(10)``,
      which names a perfectly good depth. Above
      :data:`MAX_QOS_HISTORY_DEPTH` the pybind11 conversion fails instead.

    So the floor, the ``bool`` refusal and the strict-``int`` requirement all
    come from :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error`, the shared
    domain for a discrete count consumed directly by a C API rather than
    coerced, and only the transport's ceiling is added here - beside the

    set a distinguishing default ``node_name`` but share every publish path so
    a simulated robot and a real one are byte-for-byte identical on the wire.
    Topic naming and the inbound command contract come from
    :class:`RosTelemetryBase`, which the pure-RTPS bridge also derives from, so
    the rclpy and cyclonedds transports advertise the same topics.

    Args:
        domain_id: ROS 2 domain (``ROS_DOMAIN_ID``) the bridge publishes on.
            Only an ``int`` in ``[0, 232]`` names a domain: RTPS derives its
            discovery ports from it, and 233 lands past the end of the port space.
            One domain per process: a context's domain is fixed when it is
            initialized, so a bridge built in a process that already has a
            running ``rclpy`` context joins that context's domain, and asking
            for another one is refused rather than published elsewhere.
        node_name: Name of the internal rclpy node.
        qos_depth: Depth of the publishers' KEEP_LAST history. Only a
            positive ``int`` up to ``MAX_QOS_HISTORY_DEPTH`` names a depth
            the transport can build a publisher with; the publishers are

        Best-effort, and safe to call more than once. The two steps release two
        independent resources - a node handle and the process-wide rclpy context
        - so neither failure is allowed to skip the other:

        * A node that will not be destroyed (rclpy raises ``InvalidHandle`` or
          ``RCLError`` from the C layer) is logged at debug, because the context
          shutdown below takes the node down with it. Letting it propagate left
          the context this bridge initialized running for the life of the
          process: ``_owns_context`` stays set, so the next bridge finds
          ``rclpy.ok()`` already true, disclaims ownership, and never shuts it
          down either - and both call sites tear the bridge down inside a
          suppressing block, so the leaked participant and its discovery
          threads were never reported to anyone.
        * A context that will not shut down is logged at *warning*, because
          nothing after it retries: that failure is the last word on a
          participant still on the wire.
