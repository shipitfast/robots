"""Shared operator-approval gate for the tools that command a ROS 2 graph.

:mod:`~strands_robots.tools.use_ros`, :mod:`~strands_robots.tools.use_rtps` and
:mod:`~strands_robots.tools.use_rosbridge` reach a ROS 2 graph over three
different transports - in-process rclpy, raw RTPS, and a rosbridge WebSocket -
and every one of them can carry a command to a physical robot. A ``Twist`` on
``/cmd_vel`` moves the same base whichever of the three wrote it, so this module
is the single owner of the approval decision: it cannot differ between two
transports onto the same graph, where the same publish would otherwise be
refused by one and silently sent by the other.

That is not hypothetical. The gate shipped in :mod:`~strands_robots.tools.use_ros`
alone, so an agent declined at ``/cmd_vel`` could re-issue the identical command
through either sibling and it went out with no prompt, no allowlist check and no
audit row - the tool name was the whole difference. A blocklist is a statement
about a physical surface, not about a wire format, so it belongs beside the
mechanism that enforces it rather than in one of the three callers.

Which actions carry a command is a property of the transport and stays at each
call site: ``use_ros`` gates a topic ``publish``, a ``service_call`` and an
``action_send_goal``; ``use_rtps`` speaks no service or action protocol, so only
its ``publish`` can command; ``use_rosbridge`` gates ``publish`` and
``service_call``. Reading a surface is never gated on any transport, and neither
is ``use_rtps``'s ``advertise``, which creates a publisher without writing a
sample. The same reasoning keeps the per-action numeric-option tables beside
their dispatch in :mod:`~strands_robots.tools._numeric_options`.

The decision is not ROS-shaped, though. :func:`gate_motion` is the same
allowlist -> bypass -> operator-interrupt -> audit-row path with the blocklist
factored out, for tools whose command surface is not a graph name at all: a
Unitree SDK RPC (``loco.SetVelocity``), a serial write to a motor bus where
the target is a port and the verb is a wire instruction, an arm motion named
by the pose action carrying it, or a rollout the real-hardware ``Robot`` agent
tool dispatches, where the target is the robot and the verb is ``execute`` or
``start``. Such a caller names its own allowlist variable and its own way of
matching it; the interrupt, the
fail-closed rule and the audit row are the one copy here, so an operator's "no"
means the same thing whichever tool asked. :func:`gate_command` is now a thin
blocklist front on that path.

Which is why the module sits at the package root rather than under
:mod:`strands_robots.tools`, where it was first written: its callers are six tool
modules *and* :mod:`~strands_robots.hardware_robot`, so the layer it belongs to
is the lowest of them. A safety decision one caller has to reach upward for is a
decision the next caller copies.

    same reader in the same place, with no operator and a command that will be
    refused again. So both carry this sentence: naming the variable in one
    refusal and nothing at all in the other is what made the second a dead end.

    The remedy has to name the VALUE, not just the variable. The allowlist
    takes the spelling this tool's matcher accepts (``execute``, ``/cmd_vel``,
    ``loco.SetVelocity``), so the natural readings - ``=1``, ``=true`` -
    pre-approve nothing and the identical refusal comes back after the advice
    was followed. When the variable is set to such a value, say so first.

    ``*`` is offered only when this tool's matcher honours it. The ROS
    transports match through :func:`match_blocklist`, which canonicalises the
    entry ``*`` to ``/*`` and so matches nothing; advertising ``=*`` there is
    advice that loops back to this same refusal. The matcher is asked, as it
    is for the value itself, rather than the tool named.
