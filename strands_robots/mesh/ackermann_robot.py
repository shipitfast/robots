"""Ackermann ROS 2 mesh bridge - steering-geometry cars as strands robots.

An :class:`AckermannRosRobot` wraps an Ackermann-steering ROS 2 car (reference
platform: AWS DeepRacer) so an agent can drive it with the same
``Agent(tools=robot.tools)`` pattern as every other strands robot. Ackermann
platforms differ from the differential-drive bases served by
:class:`~strands_robots.mesh.ros_bridge.RosBridgedRobot` in three ways this
class absorbs:

1. Commands are normalized servo pairs (``angle``/``throttle`` in [-1, 1]),
   not ``geometry_msgs/msg/Twist``. :meth:`drive` keeps the fleet-wide
   ``(linear, angular)`` contract and converts internally with a bicycle
   model, so the agent never learns a second vocabulary.
2. The vehicle must be switched into a commandable state first (the DeepRacer
   needs a two-step manual-mode service handshake). ``init_services`` declares
   that handshake; :meth:`drive` runs it once, automatically, before the first
   command and refuses to drive if it fails.
3. There is no odometry topic on the stock platform, so there is deliberately
   no ``get_pose`` here.

All ROS 2 I/O forwards through :func:`strands_robots.tools.use_ros.use_ros`,
so the bridge owns no rclpy state and is safe to construct without ROS 2.

Commanding the car goes through ``use_ros``'s operator-approval gate, because a
servo topic that moves a vehicle and the mode services that arm it are
safety-critical surfaces. The bridge forwards an operator context to it: the
``drive_<node>`` / ``stop_<node>`` agent tools are declared ``@tool(context=True)``
and hand the context to :func:`use_ros`, so an agent driving this car prompts the
operator exactly as a direct ``use_ros`` call does. The read path
(:meth:`get_scan`) is never gated.

A **programmatic** call carries no operator context, so it is refused unless the
surfaces are pre-approved with ``STRANDS_ROS2_COMMAND_ALLOW`` (or the gate is
bypassed with ``BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true``). That includes :meth:`stop` and the
trailing halt of a timed :meth:`drive`: the gate is keyed on the *surface*, not
on the payload, so a zero servo message is gated like a full-throttle one.

Typical usage::

    import os

    from strands import Agent
    from strands_robots.mesh import AckermannRosRobot

    car = AckermannRosRobot.from_deepracer(node_name="deepracer")

    # Direct, programmatic control - nobody to prompt, so the command surfaces
    # this car uses have to be pre-approved (bare names cover the namespaced
    # DeepRacer spellings):
    os.environ["STRANDS_ROS2_COMMAND_ALLOW"] = "/manual_drive,/vehicle_state,/enable_state"
    car.drive(linear=0.5, duration=2.0)   # forward half a metre per second
    print(car.get_scan())                 # reads are never gated

    # Or hand the bridge to an agent as first-class tools - the command tools
    # carry the operator context, so the gate prompts instead of refusing:
    agent = Agent(tools=car.tools)
    agent("drive forward slowly for two seconds, then read the lidar")
