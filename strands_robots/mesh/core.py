    """Parse a positive-float env var, falling back to default on bad input.

    Catches the case where an operator sets ``STRANDS_MESH_RESUME_FRESHNESS_S=abc``
    or a negative value. The module would otherwise fail to import with an opaque
    ``ValueError`` (found by running the module under bad env locally).

    A non-finite value falls back too, and that test cannot be folded into the
    range check below: ``float`` accepts ``"nan"``, ``"inf"`` and ``"1e999"``
    (which overflows to ``inf``), and ``nan < minimum`` is ``False``, so a
    ``nan`` passed a bare range test and was returned as the resolved knob.

    Every knob resolved here is one side of a comparison on a safety path, and
    a ``nan`` does not widen those comparisons but removes them. It makes the
    presence stale/future test (``age > window or age < -skew``) ``False`` for
    **every** envelope, so a year-old presence is accepted. It reaches
    :func:`_evict_replay_cache` as ``ttl_s``, where ``cutoff = now - nan``
    leaves every stale replay entry in the cache. And it reaches the resume
    brute-force cooldown as ``locked_until = monotonic() + nan``, which no
    later ``now < locked_until`` test can satisfy, so the throttle protecting
    the E-stop override code never engages. ``inf`` fails open on the first two
    and closed on the third: that cooldown never expires, so a resume can never
    be granted again.

    This is the rule :func:`~strands_robots.mesh.security._env_pos_float`
    already documents and applies for the teleop input bound, and which
    :func:`~strands_robots.mesh._zenoh_config._float_env` and
    :func:`~strands_robots.mesh.session.hz_from_env` also apply. Those three
    resolvers and this one answer the same question about the same kind of
    operator input, so what counts as usable must not differ between them.

    The floor is deliberately left alone: ``0`` is still accepted (``minimum``
    defaults to ``0.0``) because what a zero means differs per knob - a zero
    backoff is arguably "no cooldown" while a zero freshness window drops every
    envelope - and that is a per-knob decision rather than this domain's.

    The companion :func:`_parse_positive_int_env` needs no such test: ``int``
    refuses ``"nan"``, ``"inf"`` and ``"1e999"`` outright, so every non-finite
    spelling already reaches its ``ValueError`` fallback.

    # without the dispatch layer dropping either silently.
    #
    # This is the set ``SimEngine.run_policy`` documents, because its
    # ``policy_kwargs`` entry offers this path as the analogue of the local
    # call ("the local-sim analogue of the mesh ``tell()`` path, which already
    # forwards these keys"). Two directions, both mechanical: a key that
    # docstring names and this tuple omits is dropped after the wire admits
    # it, and a key admitted here that no provider reads is inert.
    #
    # ``target_velocity`` is the locomotion goal - WBC / wbc_gait read
    # ``[vx, vy, omega]``, microduck accepts that or ``[vx, vy]``. Every one of
    # those providers is reachable over the mesh: the policy-provider
    # allowlist is derived from the registry (see

        ``_execute_task_sync`` / ``start_task``. This helper bridges the
        ``tell()`` wire payload to those methods.

        ``robot_name`` resolution:
            * Use ``cmd["robot_name"]`` when present.

        forwards verbatim to every

        ``policy_config`` instead, a goal reaches the Policy constructor,
        where no provider reads it as a per-call goal - cuRobo and MoveIt2
        name no goal key there at all, and WBC's constructor
        ``target_velocity`` is a *static* default a per-call kwarg overrides -
        so the goal would be absorbed and the provider would then refuse the
        payload the caller supplied. Per #300
        the receiving Policy ignores unknown per-call kwargs rather than
        raising, so VLA providers stay compatible.

        The ZID is established during the Zenoh session bootstrap that
        follows the mTLS handshake; it is unique per session and cannot
        be chosen by the caller. Used in two places:

        1. As the ``source_zid`` field embedded in safety envelope
           bodies. Combined with the receiver-side check
           ``body.source_zid == sample.source_info.source_id.zid`` this
           closes the cross-session forgery window where an attacker
           in a different session would have to convince Zenoh to
           attach a wire-level ``source_id.zid`` that does not match
           the body field. Zenoh-python exposes no public constructor
           for ``ZenohId``/``EntityGlobalId``, so this binding is
           bounded by the trust roots in ``connect.tls``.

        2. As an HMAC input on resume envelopes so a captured
           override-proof bound to one session's wire identity cannot
           be replayed from a different session even if the attacker
           also holds the override code (see
           :meth:`_resume_lockout`).

        Returns ``None`` for non-Zenoh transports (bridge / IoT) and
        when no session is currently open. In that case the safety
        path falls back to the body-level HMAC binding alone -- the
        cross-session-forgery defence is Zenoh-specific because only
        Zenoh exposes a TLS-bound publisher identity.

        Also returns ``None`` if the session module import fails. That arm is
        defence in depth rather than a reachable configuration: this module
        imports ``strands_robots.mesh.session`` at module scope, so by the time
        any method runs the module is already resolved and the local import
        cannot raise. It is kept so a future refactor that drops the
        module-scope import degrades here instead of raising on the safety path.

        importable, and the ``zenoh.SourceInfo`` constructor present -- it first
        ships in eclipse-zenoh 1.6.1, the declared ``[mesh]`` floor). Returns
        ``None`` when the SourceInfo-less fallback ``put()`` path -- which

        This is the single decision point an issuer must consult BEFORE

        over a byte string that lacks ``source_zid`` and the proof never
        verifies -- leaving the fleet stuck in lockout.

        A runtime ``publisher.put`` failure after this returns a zid still
        degrades to the stripped fallback; for a resume that means the proof
        will not verify and the peer stays locked out -- the fail-safe
