"""Native daemon driver for the Pollen Robotics Reachy Mini.

``Robot("reachy_mini", mode="real", port="reachy-a.local:8000")`` builds one of
these. The instance satisfies
:class:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.HardwareDriver`, so
:func:`~strands_robots.robot.Robot` returns it and the mesh, teleop rail and
agent tool surface consume it exactly like the lerobot driver they replace for
this robot. There is nothing to replace in practice: the Reachy Mini has no
lerobot robot type, so before this driver ``mode="real"`` raised
``ValueError: Unsupported robot type: 'reachy_mini'``.

Why a native driver rather than a lerobot entry: the Mini is an expressive desk
robot - a 6-DOF Stewart head on a rotating body, two antennas, a speaker and a
recorded-emotion library - with no arms and no gait. lerobot's robot classes
model a serial servo bus or a network arm; the Mini is addressed through the
Reachy daemon's REST API plus a real-time link, and its state of interest is
head orientation rather than a joint-space arm pose.

What the driver actually does:

* Probes ``GET /api/daemon/status`` in :meth:`~ReachyDriver.connect_eagerly` -
  the reachability check, and the same call that reports which hardware variant
  answered. The daemon WebSocket serves both **Lite** and **Wireless** hardware
  (verified on daemon 1.10.0). An explicitly supplied Wireless bridge transport
  retains the Zenoh path. Both links come from
  :mod:`strands_robots.device_connect.reachy_transport`, which the Device
  Connect driver already ships - this module reuses them rather than growing a
  second daemon client.
* Runs that link on one background asyncio loop and caches what it delivers.
  ``_imu`` is the head IMU verbatim; ``_pose`` is the head orientation, taken
  from the IMU quaternion because the Mini's IMU is *in the head*; ``_battery``
  is read from the daemon status payload when it carries one. The mesh reads all
  three with ``getattr(robot, name, None)``, so a Mini that has not connected
  publishes no sensor topic and is otherwise complete.
* Refuses a motion write outside the envelope, naming the limit, via the shared
  :func:`~strands_robots.drivers.reachy_envelope.envelope_error`.

Deliberately absent, so a reader is not left guessing:

* **No** ``_lidar_*``. The Mini has no lidar.
* No forward kinematics of the Stewart platform. The link reports six leg
  positions; turning those into a head pose needs a model of the platform this
  repo does not have, so the legs are cached as legs (``_joints``) and the head
  *orientation* comes from the IMU rather than being derived from them.
  Inventing the kinematics would put a number on the mesh that nothing
  measured.
* ``start_task`` and ``run_policy`` refuse outright rather than standing in for
  work in progress. A recorded emotion is not a policy rollout: with no arms and
  no gait there is no action space for a policy to be trained against, so the
  refusal names the recorded-move path instead of implying a rollout is coming.

Nothing here imports a transport at module load: every daemon touch is inside a
method body, so the module imports on Thor, on CI and in every unit test with a
mocked daemon.

                bring-up work without either knowing about the other.
            cameras: Accepted for parity with the lerobot driver. The Mini's
                camera is reached through the daemon rather than v4l2, so this
                driver does not open it.
            data_config: Accepted for parity; unused.
            port: The daemon host, optionally with a port -
                ``"reachy-a.local"`` or ``"reachy-a.local:8000"``. ``port`` is
                polymorphic across drivers by contract; here it names a host,
                because that is what addresses a Mini. ``None`` reads
                ``REACHY_HOST``/``REACHY_PORT`` from the environment, and when
                those are unset too :meth:`connect_eagerly` discovers the daemon:
                ``localhost`` (a Lite, or a process on the robot) and then
                ``reachy-mini.local`` (a Wireless's factory mDNS name), taking
                the first that answers ``/api/daemon/status`` without an error.
                Until then ``_host`` reads ``localhost``.
            api_port: Daemon port to use when ``port`` carries no ``:port``
                suffix. An explicit suffix in ``port`` wins.
            media_port: Native GStreamer LAN signaling port used for camera capture.
            zenoh_prefix: Zenoh key prefix for a Wireless Mini. Defaults to
                ``tool_name``, so two Minis do not share a key space.
            transport: Zenoh transport for a Wireless Mini, passed through to
                :class:`~strands_robots.device_connect.reachy_transport.ZenohLink`.
                ``None`` selects the daemon WebSocket on either hardware variant;
                supplying a transport keeps the Wireless Zenoh bridge path.
            tts_url: Base URL of a Piper/``tiny-tts`` speech service for
                :meth:`say`. ``None`` reads ``REACHY_TTS_URL`` and otherwise
                combines the daemon host with port 5002 at call time (where
                ``tiny-the-reachy`` installs its ``tiny-tts.service``). Speech
                synthesis is not part of the Reachy daemon.

        loop, and ``loop.close()`` is that call's documented
        counterpart: it releases the selector and the self-pipe the loop opened.
        ``loop.stop()`` is not that counterpart - it only asks ``run_forever`` to
        return. So a teardown that stops without closing abandons an open loop,
        and Python says so: every connect/teardown cycle raised one
        ``ResourceWarning: unclosed event loop``, reported not here but wherever
        the collector happened to reclaim it, which is code that has nothing to
        do with this driver.

        The wait is not politeness, it is what makes the close legal: closing a
        loop that is still running raises ``RuntimeError``, and ``stop()`` is
        asynchronous - it schedules the stop and returns, so the thread is still
        inside ``run_forever`` when it does. Waiting for the thread is therefore

        Three gates, in this order:

        1. The driver is connected. A write to a link that was never started has
           nowhere to go.
        2. Every numeric value is finite, and every bounded axis is inside the
           envelope - both from the shared
           :func:`~strands_robots.drivers.reachy_envelope.envelope_error`, so this driver
           and the ``reachy_*`` tools cannot disagree about the same robot. An
           action carrying ``body_yaw`` and no head pose is checked against the
           head yaw this driver last commanded, so the head-body coupling limit
           applies to a body-only turn as well as to a pair: the daemon holds
           the head pose and turns the body no further than the limit, so a
           lone body yaw beyond it would report success and stop short. The
           limit is skipped, not guessed, while that target is unknown.
        3. Every key names something this driver can send. An action naming no
           axis at all is refused rather than reported as a successful no-op,
           and so is one that names a real axis alongside a key this driver has
           no actuator for: a dropped head axis is not left alone but commanded
           to zero, because the daemon's head command is a whole pose.

        Degrees in, radians and pose matrices out. The caller-facing unit is
        degrees because the envelope is expressed in degrees and because the
        daemon's own RPC surface takes degrees; the wire wants radians for a
        joint and a 4x4 matrix for the head, which
        :func:`~strands_robots.device_connect.reachy_transport.rpy_to_pose`
        builds.

                (degrees), ``antenna_left``, ``antenna_right`` (degrees). Absent
                head axes default to zero, so ``{"head_yaw": 20}`` means "look
                20 degrees left, level" rather than "leave pitch as it was" -
                the daemon's head command is a whole pose, not a delta.
            robot_name: Accepted for contract parity. This driver fronts exactly
                one Mini, so a name that is neither ``None`` nor this driver's

                within 0.5 monotonic seconds. Only complete, finite joint frames

                or retry; a timeout leaves delivery uncertain. Default false
                preserves the existing fire-and-forget link path. Neither path
