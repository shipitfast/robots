"""Subscription and publication helpers for the G1 driver's read and write paths.

The driver holds one :class:`DDSSubscriberSet` and asks it for background
subscribers whose callbacks fill in-memory caches (the newest message wins).
The mesh publishes those caches at its own cadence, so the DDS callback stays
fast: parse, drop into a slot, return.

The driver also holds one :class:`DDSPublisher` for the ``rt/lowcmd`` write
path (and any other topic the control loop grows in issue #361). Publishers
are cached per ``(topic, message_class)`` and constructed under the shared
:data:`_DDS_INIT_LOCK`; that is the same lock the subscriber set holds, so a
reader and a writer never construct concurrently on the CycloneDDS bindings
that segfault under it.

Neither class imports ``unitree_sdk2py`` at module load: the SDK is loaded
lazily inside :meth:`DDSSubscriberSet.subscribe` and
:meth:`DDSPublisher.get_publisher`. That is what lets every test in this repo
mock the bus and skips the SDK entirely on headless machines.

    ``ChannelSubscriber.__init__`` and ``ChannelPublisher.__init__`` create a
    live ``Channel`` before ``Init`` runs, and ``Init`` is not atomic either:
    ``unitree_sdk2py`` starts the ``ch_reader`` daemon thread *before* it
    constructs the ``DataReader`` that can raise. A construction that fails
    part way therefore leaves an endpoint holding real DDS state, and for a

    :meth:`DDSSubscriberSet.close` documents, which keeps the channel

    Such an endpoint is unreachable from :meth:`DDSSubscriberSet.close` and
