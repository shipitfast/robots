"""Motion-switcher decoder for the G1 driver's FSM gate.

The G1 driver's ``_check_motion_gates`` refuses every arm-SDK write while
``_fsm_id`` is ``None``. On the shipped tree that attribute has exactly one
writer (the ``None`` initialiser in ``__init__``); the ``rt/lowstate`` topic
carries ``mode_machine`` but not the high-level FSM state, so the missing
producer is the motion-switcher API, not the DDS bus.

Issue #2765 lists the wire-format decisions the write path depends on and
names this decoder as the FSM producer's home. This module is the *checkable*
half of that answer: it owns the read-side of the API, decodes the FSM id from
``MotionSwitcherClient.CheckMode()`` in exactly one place, and refuses a shape
the SDK does not name rather than guessing. Wiring the decoder onto the driver
is a separate step -- see #2765. A pin in the driver's test tree asserts that
``_fsm_id`` has exactly one assignment today (the ``None`` initialiser in
``G1Driver.__init__``) and that a healthy driver still refuses with ``FSM id
unknown``; both flip on the day a second writer lands, so the wire and that
pin's replacement belong in one change.

What the SDK reports.  ``MotionSwitcherClient.CheckMode`` returns
``(status, result)``: ``status`` is a Unitree response code (``0`` is OK,
``ERR_CODES`` render the rest) and ``result`` is a dict whose ``name`` key
carries the current motion mode as a string -- ``""`` when no mode is
selected, otherwise a mode label such as ``"ai"`` or ``"normal"``. The
mode label alone does not identify the FSM state the gate reads, so this
decoder also reads an integer FSM id from the ``form`` key.

``form`` is *not* evidenced by the SDK. ``CheckMode`` returns
``json.loads(data)`` straight from the robot, so the Python package cannot
tell us which keys that payload carries, and the string ``"form"`` appears
nowhere in ``unitree_sdk2py``: every SDK example reads ``result['name']``
and nothing else (the G1 low-level example loops
``while result['name']: self.msc.ReleaseMode()``). Which key carries the
FSM id is therefore one of the wire-format questions #2765 tracks, and
answering it needs a robot. Until then this decoder refuses an active mode
whose payload has no integer ``form`` rather than defaulting -- so a wrong
guess here surfaces as a named refusal, never as an FSM id the gate might
open on. Both values are surfaced so a caller sees the reason a decode
declined rather than only the outcome.

Wire-side invariants this decoder enforces.

* ``unitree_sdk2py`` is **not** imported at module load. Every SDK read goes
  through :func:`_load_motion_switcher_client`, which lazy-imports the class
  and is the seam every unit test mocks. This keeps the module importable
  on Thor and CI (mirrors the invariant :mod:`._dds_engine` and
  :mod:`._common` already carry).
* The mapping from ``CheckMode()`` return-shape to ``_fsm_id`` value is
  spelled once, here, in :func:`decode_fsm_id`. A driver-side wire (the
  step #2765 defers) reads the return of this function; there is no second
  copy of "which key carries the FSM" to disagree with.
* A shape the SDK never returns (``None`` for the result dict, an integer
  under ``name``, a missing ``form`` on an active mode) refuses with a
  message naming the received shape, rather than defaulting to a value
  the gate might silently open on.

Related: :mod:`._common` carries ``HANDSHAKE_FSMS = {500, 501, 801}`` and
``WALK_FSMS = {501, 801}``; membership in those sets is the gate's admission
question. This decoder does not evaluate membership -- that is the driver's
job, and stays there -- it only produces the value the gate compares.

    ``CheckMode`` returns a ``(status, result)`` pair. Both values need to

    itself failed, and a well-formed result on a failed RPC is not a
    truthful reading. The refusal path names the code via :func:`decode_code`
    so a firmware update surfaces at least as its integer.

    On the OK branch, the result dict carries a ``name`` (the mode label)
    and, when a mode is active, a ``form`` (the FSM id as an integer).
    ``name == ""`` is the SDK's "no motion mode selected" reading and is
