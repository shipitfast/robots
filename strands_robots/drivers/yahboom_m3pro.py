"""Yahboom ROSMASTER M3 Pro native driver - the robot's ROS 2 interface, driven.

The M3 Pro is a mecanum chassis carrying the DOFBOT-Pro arm. Its motors live
behind an STM32 expansion board running **micro-ROS** firmware; the Jetson (or
Raspberry Pi) on the chassis runs ROS 2 Humble and a ``micro_ros_agent`` that
puts the board's topics on the graph. That graph *is* the vendor's control
interface - the desktop app, the web console and every Yahboom demo node speak
it - so this driver speaks it too, rather than the serial protocol underneath:

* ``/cmd_vel`` (``geometry_msgs/Twist``) - the base. ``linear.x`` forward,
  ``linear.y`` **strafe** (it is a mecanum base), ``angular.z`` yaw, SI units.
  The firmware zeroes the motors after roughly 200-500 ms without a fresh
  message, so a held move is a stream at :data:`PUBLISH_RATE_HZ` followed by an
  explicit zero, and a single frame is a ~0.3 s twitch by design.
* ``/arm6_joints`` (``arm_msgs/ArmJoints``) - all six servos at once:
  ``joint1..joint6`` in **integer degrees** (``int16``) plus ``time`` in
  milliseconds. Joints 1-4 travel 0-180, joint 5 0-270, joint 6 is the gripper
  and travels 30 (closed) to 180 (open). The board holds a commanded pose, so
  one message is enough - unlike ``/cmd_vel``.
* ``/arm_joint`` (``arm_msgs/ArmJoint``) - one servo: ``id`` 1-6, ``joint``
  degrees, ``time`` ms.
* ``/odom_raw`` (``nav_msgs/Odometry``), ``/imu/data_raw``
  (``sensor_msgs/Imu``) and ``/scan0`` / ``/scan1`` (``sensor_msgs/LaserScan``,
  two lidars whose sweeps overlap into near-360 degree cover) - the reads.

Three transports answer that graph, chosen by ``transport=``:

* ``"rosbridge"`` (default) - ``rosbridge_server`` on the robot, dialled over a
  WebSocket from *any* host with ``pip install 'strands-robots[rosbridge]'``:
  a laptop, CI, a fleet controller. ``port=`` is ``host[:port]`` of the bridge
  (default :data:`DEFAULT_ROSBRIDGE`). Interface types are the two-segment
  spellings rosbridge transmits.
* ``"ros2"`` - in-process ``rclpy`` for a driver running **on** the robot's
  own computer, inside its ROS environment (``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` is 30 on the
  shipped image); ``port=`` is then ignored. The same three-segment types the
  ``use_ros`` tool speaks.
* ``"twin"`` - the ``yahboom_m3pro`` MuJoCo model, answering the same topics
  (:class:`~strands_robots.drivers.yahboom_m3pro_twin.M3ProTwinGraph`). The
  same tool, verbs and units an agent uses on the robot, over the simulation:
  what an agent learns to say to the twin it says to the hardware. ``sim=``
  hands in a built engine; otherwise one is built at the ``home`` keyframe.

The first two forward through the transports this package already owns
(:func:`strands_robots.rosbridge.rosbridge_action` /
:func:`strands_robots.ros.ros_action`), so the driver holds no socket and no
node, and every write to ``/cmd_vel`` passes the shared operator gate
(:mod:`strands_robots._command_gate`): ``/cmd_vel`` is on the blocklist, so a
base command is approved by the agent's operator, pre-approved with
``STRANDS_ROS2_COMMAND_ALLOW=/cmd_vel``, or refused - and a Python caller with
no agent sets that variable, exactly as it would for
:class:`~strands_robots.mesh.RosbridgeRobot`. The arm topics are not on the
blocklist, so arm commands pass without a prompt, like every other arm here.

**Sim parity.** :meth:`YahboomM3ProDriver.send_action` speaks the *model's*
vocabulary - ``arm1.pos .. arm5.pos`` and ``gripper.pos`` in radians, the joint
names and ranges of the ``yahboom_m3pro`` MJCF - and converts at the wire. The
description's ``home`` keyframe is written as ``q = (deg - 90) * pi / 180``,
so the inverse ``deg = 90 + degrees(q)`` maps the URDF ranges onto the servo
ranges exactly: ``+-pi/2`` onto 0-180 for joints 1-4 and ``-pi/2..pi`` onto
0-270 for joint 5 (:func:`arm_rad_to_deg`). The gripper crank ``rlink1``
travels ``-1.54`` (closed) to ``0`` (open) and maps linearly onto 30-180
(:func:`gripper_rad_to_deg`). A policy that acted in the twin acts on the
robot without a remapping layer; ``joint_signs`` flips any servo the bench
shows reversed, because polarity is the one thing a URDF cannot tell you.

Out of scope, honestly: the board publishes no arm joint-state topic this
driver can verify, so :meth:`YahboomM3ProDriver.get_observation` returns ``{}``
on the robot rather than echoing the last *command* back as a *reading* - it
reads ``/joint_states`` only where the graph carries one, which the twin's
does; the cameras
(Orbbec on the wrist, a USB camera on the chassis) are ROS image topics a
caller reads with ``use_rosbridge``/``use_ros`` ``echo`` or a lerobot camera
config, not through this driver; and no policy provider is wired, so
``start_task`` / ``run_policy`` refuse with the route (drive ``send_action`` on
your own timer).
