"""Feetech STS/SMS-series wire format. Pure, no I/O.

The STS3215 and its SCS/SMS siblings share a Protocol 1-shaped bus that is
close to Dynamixel's older Protocol 1 but not identical to Protocol 2. This
codec is verifiable against ``scservo_sdk`` byte-for-byte (the vendor SDK on
PyPI); as with :mod:`~strands_robots.drivers.dynamixel.protocol`, the point of
extracting it is not dependency avoidance but grading, since the SDK's own
parser lives inside :meth:`PacketHandler.readTxRx` and cannot be exercised
without a serial port.

**Framing is shared across the family; the two-byte word order is not.** Feetech
publishes one framing document for the whole family (`SCS Communication`_ below,
which is where the frame above comes from), and the vendor SDK is one package for
all of it - but that SDK carries a global end-ness its ``PacketHandler`` sets
from a per-model protocol number, and the two orders are the reverse of each
other:

.. code-block:: text

    protocol 0  STS3215, STS3250, SM8512BL   low byte first
    protocol 1  SCS0009 and the SCS series   high byte first

So a two-byte register value framed for one series is a *different value* on the
other, not a mis-scaled one: 1023 written low-byte-first is read as 65283 by an
SCS-series servo. This module implements protocol 0 - :func:`encode_word` and
:func:`decode_word` are that order, named so the whole package reads it from one
place, and :data:`MAX_GOAL_POSITION` is the STS/SMS full scale (the SCS series is
10-bit, a quarter of it). Supporting an SCS-series servo is therefore a second
word order and a second full scale rather than a parameter, and nothing here
claims to do it; see :issue:`2812`.

Wire frame (from the Feetech STS3215 datasheet, `SCS Communication`_):

.. code-block:: text

    HEADER1  HEADER2  ID    LEN     INSTR   P1..PN   CHECKSUM
    0xFF     0xFF     <id>  <n+2>   <op>    <n bytes> <sum>

- ``ID`` is 0..253 for a specific servo, ``0xFE`` for a broadcast (no reply).
- ``LEN`` counts ``INSTR`` + params + checksum, i.e. ``n + 2``.
- ``CHECKSUM = (~(ID + LEN + INSTR + sum(params))) & 0xFF``.
  This is the *additive* checksum Feetech uses. Protocol 2's CRC-16 does not
  apply here. :mod:`~strands_robots.tools.pose_tool` already uses this
  formula inline; the codec here reuses the *same* bit pattern so a frame
  built by :func:`build_packet` is byte-identical to one the pose tool would
  emit, and :func:`parse_status_packet` accepts what
  :func:`~strands_robots.tools.pose_tool._parse_status_packet` accepts.
- No byte-stuffing. Protocol 2 stuffs to break the ``FF FF FD`` prefix out of
  payloads; Feetech's Protocol 1 tolerates ``FF`` inside a param because the
  parser resyncs on the ``FF FF`` header pair and a following byte cannot be
  ``FF`` (LEN is at most 0xFC on any real read, and the ID byte is 0..0xFE).

.. _SCS Communication: https://www.feetechrc.com/PDF/EN%20SCS%20Communication%20Protocol.pdf

The status packet a servo returns is the same shape with an ERR byte in front
of the parameters (``FF FF ID LEN ERR P1..PN CHECKSUM``), so
:func:`parse_status_packet` shares the framing check with :func:`build_packet`
and only differs in what it consumes after ``INSTR``.

Nothing here opens a serial port. The one function that would want the port
- ``read_register`` say - is deliberately in the bus module (see :issue:`360`
scope 1) so this module can be imported on any host in CI.

Register addresses are declared in :class:`Register`. The STS3215 EEPROM/SRAM
map spans 0x00..0x53; only the registers the driver actually reads or writes
are named here. Adding a register is a one-line entry with a comment naming
the datasheet page it comes from.

    A servo that did not answer, answered a frame that does not verify, or was
