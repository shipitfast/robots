"""Native Feetech STS/SMS-series driver satisfying :class:`HardwareDriver`.

This driver drives the arm. :mod:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus` opens
the SCS serial port, so ``send_action`` writes goal positions and the joints
reach the mesh - that is :issue:`360` scope 1, which the driver named as
deferred when it landed as a stub against the driver seam (:issue:`353` /
:pr:`2734`).

What works and what does not:

* ``send_action`` - writes the commanded joints in one SYNC_WRITE frame.
  Targets are **degrees** (``gripper`` is percent open); a key may be spelled
  ``shoulder_pan`` or ``shoulder_pan.pos``, matching lerobot's suffix - but only
  one of the two per motor, because both name the same servo.
* ``bus`` / ``is_connected`` - the pair
  :func:`strands_robots.bus_access.joint_read_source` resolves, so an SO-arm
  publishes ``joints`` on the mesh state topic without a wrapper. This is the
  documented seam for a driver that owns its motors; a ``state()`` method is
  not part of :data:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.DRIVER_SURFACE` and no
  shipped driver has one.
* ``stop`` - releases torque on every motor, reporting any that stayed driven.
* ``start_task`` / ``run_policy`` - still refused, and now for the *accurate*
  reason: a policy needs a control loop (rate, action horizon, a thread that
  can be stopped), which is its own slice. The refusal no longer blames the
  bus, because the bus is here.

None of this pretends. Every refusal returns an envelope of the same shape a
successful path returns, so the mesh and the agent need no code change on the
day the policy loop lands.

The class is registered for every Feetech robot the package registry knows
about - see :func:`~strands_robots.drivers._register_shipped_drivers` for the
list. Registering after import (``from strands_robots.drivers.feetech import
FeetechDriver`` then :func:`register_native_driver`) is also supported and
is how an out-of-tree driver package would extend the table.

class FeetechDriver:
    """Native Feetech driver for the arms in :data:`SUPPORTED_ROBOTS`.

    The bus writes STS/SMS-series frames: that series' two-byte word order and
    its 12-bit ``Goal_Position`` full scale both come from
    :mod:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.protocol`. An SCS-series servo reads
    the same two bytes in the opposite order, so a bus of that series is not
    addressed by this driver - which is why the one SCS-series robot the registry
    declares, ``hope_jr_hand``, is absent from :data:`SUPPORTED_ROBOTS`.

    Constructor contract matches :class:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.HardwareDriver`
    - the factory builds every native driver as ``driver_cls(tool_name=...,
    cameras=..., data_config=..., **kwargs)`` and forwards the caller's extras
    in ``kwargs``. Feetech-specific keywords land in ``kwargs``:

    * ``port`` - a serial device path (``/dev/tty.usbserial-*``) for the SCS
      bus. Optional at construction; the bus opens it on connect.
    * ``baud_rate`` - a positive integer, defaults to ``1_000_000``. The Feetech
      default for STS3215 arms; SCS-series can also run at 500_000 or below and
      a caller who knows better passes it here. Held to
      :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error` - the domain
      :mod:`~strands_robots.tools.serial_tool` holds its own ``baudrate`` to -
      because pyserial coerces the speed rather than checking it, so a value
      that is not a count is applied instead of refused.
    * ``motor_ids`` - the servo IDs on the bus, in wire order. Optional at
      construction; the bus discovers them on connect.
    * ``calibration`` - this arm's own calibration: the path of the JSON
      ``lerobot-calibrate`` wrote (see
      :func:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus.lerobot_calibration_path`), or
      the records themselves. Omitting it reads and commands the servo's full
      travel instead of the arm's measured travel, which is off by however far
      the stops sit inside that rotation - so an arm that HAS been calibrated
      should be given the file, and ``get_status`` reports which of the two is
      in force under ``calibration_source``.
    * ``timeout`` - how long a read waits for a servo's reply, in seconds,
      defaulting to :data:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S`.
      Forwarded to the bus rather than recorded, for the reason ``motor_ids`` is:
      a caller who lengthens the window for a slow servo, and gets the default
      window and six motors that did not answer, has been told nothing. Held to
      :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_finite_number_error`.
