"""Native Feetech STS/SMS-series driver satisfying :class:`HardwareDriver`.

This driver drives the arm. :mod:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus` opens
the SCS serial port, so ``send_action`` writes goal positions and the joints
reach the mesh - that is :issue:`360` scope 1, which the driver named as
deferred when it landed as a stub against the driver seam (:issue:`353` /
:pr:`2734`).

What works and what does not:

* ``send_action`` - writes the commanded joints in one SYNC_WRITE frame.
  Targets are **degrees** (``gripper`` is percent open); a key may be spelled
  ``shoulder_pan`` or ``shoulder_pan.pos``, matching lerobot's suffix - but only
  one of the two per motor, because both name the same servo.
* ``bus`` / ``is_connected`` - the pair
  :func:`strands_robots.bus_access.joint_read_source` resolves, so an SO-arm
  publishes ``joints`` on the mesh state topic without a wrapper. This is the
  documented seam for a driver that owns its motors; a ``state()`` method is
  not part of :data:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.DRIVER_SURFACE` and no
  shipped driver has one.
* ``stop`` - releases torque on every motor, reporting any that stayed driven.
* ``run_policy`` / ``start_task`` - roll a policy out on a background thread at
  ``control_frequency`` (30 Hz by default, the SO-arm teleop rate). Each step
  reads the whole arm in one sync-read, hands the policy a lerobot-shaped
  ``{"<joint>.pos": degrees}`` observation and commands its action through
  ``send_action``, so a setpoint the bus refuses ends the rollout with that
  refusal as its exit reason. ``get_task_status`` reports the live snapshot and
  ``stop_task`` halts the loop, leaving the arm energized where it stands -
  ``stop`` is still the verb that de-energizes. The loop is
  :class:`~strands_robots.drivers.rollout.PolicyRollout`, shared with the UR
  driver rather than copied.

* ``transport="twin"`` - the same driver, with the arm's MuJoCo model at the
  far end of the bus (:mod:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.twin`). Every verb,
  unit and refusal above is unchanged; only the seam is. ``sim=`` hands in an
  engine already carrying the arm and ``realtime=`` steps it at wall-clock
  speed. The default transport is the serial bus, and nothing about it moves.

None of this pretends. Every refusal returns an envelope of the same shape a
successful path returns, so the mesh and the agent read one shape either way.

The class is registered for every Feetech robot the package registry knows
about - see :func:`~strands_robots.drivers._register_shipped_drivers` for the
list. Registering after import (``from strands_robots.drivers.feetech import
FeetechDriver`` then :func:`register_native_driver`) is also supported and
is how an out-of-tree driver package would extend the table.

class FeetechDriver:
    """Native Feetech driver for the arms in :data:`SUPPORTED_ROBOTS`.

    The bus writes STS/SMS-series frames: that series' two-byte word order and
    its 12-bit ``Goal_Position`` full scale both come from
    :mod:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.protocol`. An SCS-series servo reads
    the same two bytes in the opposite order, so a bus of that series is not
    addressed by this driver - which is why the one SCS-series robot the registry
    declares, ``hope_jr_hand``, is absent from :data:`SUPPORTED_ROBOTS`.

    Constructor contract matches :class:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.HardwareDriver`
    - the factory builds every native driver as ``driver_cls(tool_name=...,
    cameras=..., data_config=..., **kwargs)`` and the driver declares every
    further keyword it honours, so the factory refuses one it does not. The
    Feetech-specific keywords:

    * ``port`` - a serial device path (``/dev/tty.usbserial-*``) for the SCS
      bus. Optional at construction; the bus opens it on connect.
    * ``baud_rate`` - a positive integer, defaults to ``1_000_000``. The Feetech
      default for STS3215 arms; SCS-series can also run at 500_000 or below and
      a caller who knows better passes it here. Held to
      :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error` - the domain
      :mod:`~strands_robots.tools.serial_tool` holds its own ``baudrate`` to -
      because pyserial coerces the speed rather than checking it, so a value
      that is not a count is applied instead of refused.
    * ``motor_ids`` - the servo IDs on the bus, in wire order. Optional at
      construction; the bus discovers them on connect.
    * ``calibration`` - this arm's own calibration: the path of the JSON
      ``lerobot-calibrate`` wrote (see
      :func:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus.lerobot_calibration_path`), or
      the records themselves. Omitting it reads and commands the servo's full
      travel instead of the arm's measured travel, which is off by however far
      the stops sit inside that rotation - so an arm that HAS been calibrated
      should be given the file, and ``get_status`` reports which of the two is
      in force under ``calibration_source``.
    * ``timeout`` - how long a read waits for a servo's reply, in seconds,
      defaulting to :data:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S`.
      Forwarded to the bus rather than recorded, for the reason ``motor_ids`` is:
      a caller who lengthens the window for a slow servo, and gets the default
      window and six motors that did not answer, has been told nothing. Held to
      :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_finite_number_error`.
    * ``transport`` - one of :data:`TRANSPORTS`, default ``"serial"``. ``"twin"``
      builds the bus over the arm's MuJoCo model instead of a serial port
      (:mod:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.twin`): the same verbs, units and
      refusals, with ``sensors`` reading the model's joints. The model is the
      one the registry names for ``tool_name``, so ``tool_name`` must resolve to
      a robot in :data:`SUPPORTED_ROBOTS` with a simulation asset - refused by
      name otherwise (``hope_jr`` has no asset) - unless ``sim=`` hands in an
      engine already carrying the arm, whose robot then names the entry.
    * ``sim`` - ``twin`` only: a built sim engine (what ``Robot("so101",
      mode="sim")`` returns). ``None`` builds one on first connect; the driver
      destroys an engine it built and leaves a caller's alone.
    * ``realtime`` - ``twin`` only: step the model at wall-clock speed so a
      viewer sees the motion as the arm would make it. Default ``False``.

    The factory builds a driver as ``driver_cls(tool_name=<canonical>, ...)``
    and forwards nothing else that names the robot, so the honest source is
    ``tool_name`` resolved through the registry - unless ``sim`` already
    carries a robot, in which case that robot is the model and its name is the
    entry. A ``tool_name`` a caller chose (``"left_arm"``) resolves to nothing
    and is refused with the fix.

    Args:
        tool_name: The driver's tool name.
        sim: The caller's engine, or ``None``.
        context: The constructor's context for the refusal.

    Returns:
        A canonical name in :data:`SUPPORTED_ROBOTS` that has a simulation asset.

        ValueError: The name is not one this driver serves, or it has no asset.
