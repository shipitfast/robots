"""The Feetech bus, answered by the arm's MuJoCo model.

:class:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.driver.FeetechDriver` reaches its arm
through one seam - :class:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus.FeetechBus`,
whose ``sync_read`` answers degrees (percent for the gripper) and whose
``write_goal_positions`` takes them. Everything the driver knows about the
arm - the six motor names, the calibration records, the refusals, the tool
schema - sits above that seam. :class:`FeetechTwinBus` is a second
implementation of it against a sim engine carrying the same arm, so
``Robot("so101", mode="real", driver="strands", transport="twin")`` builds the
**hardware driver** with the model at the far end: the same tool, the same
verbs, the same units, the same refusals as over the serial port. An agent
that rehearses ``move_to`` and ``set_torque`` here says the same words to the
arm.

What the twin does with each member the driver reads off the bus:

* ``connect`` - resolves every motor on the bus to a joint of the model
  through the registry's ``joint_labels`` (the SO-101 asset names its joints
  by servo id ``1``..``6``, the SO-100's by CAD term ``Rotation``..``Jaw``,
  the bus speaks ``shoulder_pan``..``gripper``) and to the actuator driving
  that joint, refusing by name when a label or an actuator is missing. Builds
  the engine when none was handed in.
* ``write_goal_positions`` - degrees go through the bus's **own**
  :meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus.FeetechBus.to_counts` against
  this arm's calibration records, exactly as on the wire; the twin then maps
  the calibrated ``[range_min, range_max]`` counts linearly onto the joint's
  travel in the model and writes the position actuator. A calibration file
  written for a real arm therefore places the twin's joints where the real
  arm's would be. The world then steps for one bus read period (the bus's
  ``timeout``), so the servo has arrived by the next ``sync_read`` - as a
  Feetech servo has at its default speed.
* ``sync_read`` - ``Present_Position`` is the model's joint angle back through
  the inverse map to counts and through
  :meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.bus.FeetechBus.to_value`, so the
  number the driver reads is the number a real bus would report for a servo
  standing there; ``Present_Velocity`` is the model's joint velocity in counts
  per second on the same scale; ``Torque_Enable`` is the twin's own state;
  ``Present_Load`` answers ``0`` - the model carries no load sensor. Any other
  register is refused by name, as the bus refuses one it cannot read.
* ``set_torque(False)`` - zeroes the position actuators' gains, so the arm goes
  limp under gravity in the model as it does on the bench;
  ``set_torque(True)`` restores them and re-targets the present position, so
  an energized arm holds where it is rather than snapping to a stale goal. A
  ``write_goal_positions`` with torque off is refused with the sentence the
  bus uses for a bus that cannot take the write.

The travel the counts map onto is the actuator's ``ctrlrange`` when it
declares one (the SO-100 asset does) and the joint's ``range`` otherwise: the
SO-101 asset's actuators declare ``ctrlrange="0 0"``, which MuJoCo reads as
*unlimited* and not as a zero-width travel, and the twin reads it the same way.
A joint with neither is refused at ``connect``, by name. The gripper's percent
spans its joint's travel end to end, ``0`` at the end the registry's
``gripper.closed`` names.

A target the calibration admits but the model cannot reach - a count past the
travel the joint's stops span - is clamped to that travel and **reported** on
the reply and in the log, never applied silently: a twin that drove to a
different angle than the one it was asked for and said nothing would teach the
agent the wrong arm.

The operator gate is not consulted here. The driver does not consult it on the
serial bus either - an SO arm is not on the blocklist - so nothing changes; it
is stated because the design every twin follows states it.

Wall clock: the twin steps physics as fast as it can, so a move returns in
milliseconds. ``realtime=True`` sleeps each read period out instead, for a
viewer that should see the motion at the speed the arm would make it.
