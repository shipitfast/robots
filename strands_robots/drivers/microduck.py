"""Native daemon driver for the Pollen Robotics Microduck.

``Robot("microduck", mode="real")`` builds one of these. With no ``port`` the
socket is discovered: ``$MICRODUCK_SOCKET`` (a local unix path, e.g. one you
forwarded yourself), then ``$MICRODUCK_HOST`` (``[user@]host`` - the driver runs
``ssh -N -L`` and forwards robotd's socket the way an operator does; the user
defaults to ``radxa``, ``$DUCK_BOARD_USER`` is honoured as ``duckctl`` does),
then ``/run/robotd.sock`` itself - the answer when this code runs on the duck.
A ``port`` of the form ``ssh://[user@]host`` names the forward explicitly. The instance satisfies
:class:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.HardwareDriver` structurally, so
:func:`~strands_robots.robot.Robot` returns it and the mesh, teleop rail and
agent tool surface consume it exactly like any other driver.

Why a native driver: the Microduck is driven by ``robotd``, a daemon that owns
the 50 Hz control loop *and runs the walking/skill policy on-device*. Its IPC
surface (``duck-ipc-proto``) is JSON-RPC 2.0, one object per line (NDJSON), over
a unix socket. There is no lerobot robot type for it and no serial servo bus to
address; the honest client speaks ``robotd``'s protocol.

THE DECISIVE FACT - robotd exposes **no per-joint write**. The whole ``robot.*``
surface is intent-level: ``robot.move`` (twist), ``robot.head``, ``robot.pose``,
``robot.do`` (skills), ``robot.enable``/``robot.relax`` (torque), ``robot.init``,
``robot.stop``, and ``robot.state`` (read). So ``mode="real"`` is *delegate-only*
by the robot's own design: this driver sends INTENTS and robotd's on-device
policy produces the joint targets. ``run_policy``/``start_task`` therefore do not
pretend to stream a MicroduckPolicy's 14 joint targets to hardware - the wire has
no such method - they refuse and name the intent path instead. Sim-to-real parity
is preserved regardless: the on-robot policy is the *same* ``alpha_walking.onnx``
run in sim (byte-compat 0.0), so a sim rollout predicts the hardware for equal obs.

Continuous intents (``robot.move``/``robot.head``/``robot.pose``/``robot.mouth``)
are sent as JSON-RPC *notifications* (no ``id``, no reply); discrete ones
(``robot.do``/``robot.enable``/``robot.stop``/``robot.relax``) as
*requests* whose id-correlated reply is awaited.

The 15-vs-14 papercut: robotd's ``JOINT_NAMES`` is 15 wide with ``"mouth"``
spliced at index 9; the policy/sim contract is the 14 locomotion joints (no
mouth). :meth:`MicroduckDriver.read_state` drops index 9 so the joints it
publishes are the 14 the policy speaks, and mouth travels via ``robot.mouth``.

Nothing here imports a transport at module load: every socket touch is inside a
method body, so the module imports on CI and in every unit test.

                Microduck's cameras are not addressed by this driver).
            data_config: Accepted for parity; unused.
            port: Where robotd is: a unix socket path, or ``ssh://[user@]host``
                to have the driver forward the duck's sockets itself. ``None``
                discovers it - see :func:`resolve_endpoint` (``$MICRODUCK_SOCKET``,
                ``$MICRODUCK_HOST``, then :data:`DEFAULT_SOCKET`).
            api_version: API version to send in the Hello handshake, defaults to
                :data:`MICRODUCK_API_VERSION`. A robotd answering a different
                version is connected and the skew logged; each call it cannot
                serve refuses itself by name.
            timeout: Socket and request timeout in seconds. A positive, finite
                number: it is handed to ``socket.settimeout`` and to the reply
                wait, neither of which can report what it was given.
            subscribe_hz: State-stream decimation. ``None`` = every control tick;
                otherwise a positive integer, because it is sent to robotd as one.
            ssh_spawn: Process factory for the ssh forward (tests inject one);
                ``None`` means ``subprocess.Popen``.
