"""The contract a ``mode="real"`` driver satisfies.

:func:`~strands_robots.robot.Robot` with ``mode="real"`` builds one object and
hands it to everything downstream: a Strands agent invokes it as a tool, the
Zenoh mesh publishes from it, and the teleop rail commands through it. Until a
second implementation existed that object was always
:class:`strands_robots.hardware_robot.Robot`, so the surface those consumers
rely on was recorded nowhere - a driver author had to read a 3000-line class to
learn which members are load-bearing.

:class:`HardwareDriver` writes that surface down. It is deliberately the
*measured* contract rather than an aspirational one, which makes it smaller than
a reader might expect:

* ``get_observation`` is **not** a member. A lerobot robot is a wrapper: it
  holds the device that owns the bus under ``robot``, and
  :func:`strands_robots.bus_access.read_observation` takes that inner device -
  so the top-level driver is not the thing asked for a frame.

  A native driver has no inner device, and for joint telemetry that is now
  resolved rather than assumed:
  :func:`strands_robots.bus_access.joint_read_source` prefers ``robot.robot``
  and falls back to the driver itself, so a driver that owns its bus publishes
  ``joints`` on the state topic by exposing either a ``bus`` with ``sync_read``
  or a ``get_observation``, plus ``is_connected`` to say it is live. Neither is
  required, which is why neither is a member: a driver with no motors to report
  is otherwise complete.
* The sensor attributes a mesh publishes (``_pose``, ``_imu``, ``_battery`` and
  their siblings) are **not** members either. Every one is read with a
  ``getattr(robot, name, None)`` default, so a driver with no IMU publishes no
  IMU topic and is otherwise complete - making them optional by construction. A
  Protocol cannot express "optional", and requiring them would refuse a
  perfectly good arm for lacking a lidar.

What remains is the surface a driver must have for an agent to call it and for
the mesh's command and task paths to work. The four tool members
(``tool_name``, ``tool_type``, ``tool_spec``, ``stream``) are also the abstract
surface of :class:`strands.tools.tools.AgentTool`, which is what makes an object
usable as a Strands tool at all.

Structural, not nominal: a driver satisfies this by having the members, with no
import of - or inheritance from - anything here. Inheriting ``AgentTool`` is
still the easy way to get the tool quarter right.

Constructor contract (a Protocol cannot express ``__init__``): the factory
builds a native driver as
``driver_cls(tool_name=<canonical name>, cameras=<cameras or None>,
data_config=<data_config or None>, **kwargs)``, so a driver must accept those
three keywords and tolerate the caller's extras. ``port=`` arrives in
``**kwargs`` and stays polymorphic - a serial path, an IP address or a URL,
interpreted by the driver that receives it.

    """Decode a Unitree ``LowState_.motor_state`` array into per-joint readings.

    Both Unitree drivers subscribe ``rt/lowstate`` and both are handed the same
    fixed-length ``motor_state`` array, addressed by wire slot: the G1's
    ``unitree_hg`` layout declares 35 slots of which
    :data:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1._G1_JOINT_INDEX` names 29, and the Go2's
    ``unitree_go`` layout is read through
    :data:`~strands_robots.drivers.go2.GO2_JOINT_INDEX`'s 12. The array is the
    only proprioception either robot publishes, so a driver that does not read
    it commands PD targets it cannot check against a measured pose.

    One decoder rather than one per driver, for the reason the vector readers
    are written once: two copies of a coercion rule drift into disagreeing
    about which values are readings, and the copy that never gets audited is
    the one still manufacturing numbers.

    Every field is read through ``getattr(motor, name, None)`` and coerced by
    :func:`telemetry_float` / :func:`telemetry_int`, so a name a firmware
    revision drops lands ``None`` in the record rather than a typed default. A
    zero here is not a harmless placeholder: ``q=0.0`` is a valid reading of a
    joint at its zero position, so a defaulted read of a renamed field
    publishes a plausible pose - and on the G1 that pose is what a proprioceptive
    policy is handed at 500 Hz.

    A slot the array cannot answer is skipped rather than defaulted, so a
    firmware carrying fewer slots than the index names costs those joints and
    not the rest of the frame.

    Args:
        motors: The ``motor_state`` field, already defaulted to ``None`` by the
            caller's ``getattr``.
        index: Joint name to wire slot, as the driver's own index table
            declares it.

    Returns:
        A mapping of joint name to a ``{"q", "dq", "tau_est", "temperature"}``
        record for every slot the array answered, or ``None`` when the field is
        absent, bytes-like (a buffer indexes to integers, which carry none of
        these names and would read as a full-width record of ``None``), or
        answered no slot at all. ``None`` says the array was not read, which is
        a different fact from a robot reporting no joints.
