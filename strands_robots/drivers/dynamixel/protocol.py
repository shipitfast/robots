"""Dynamixel Protocol 2.0 wire format. Pure, no I/O.

Every function here is verifiable against Robotis' ``dynamixel_sdk`` byte-for
-byte, with one deliberate exception documented on :func:`_unstuff`: the SDK's
``removeStuffing`` is not the inverse of its own ``addStuffing``, so grading
against it would reintroduce a byte loss. The point of extracting the codec
from the SDK is not to avoid the
dependency - ``dynamixel_sdk`` is on PyPI and small - but to make the wire
format part of the driver's own test surface. The SDK's parser lives inside
``PacketHandler.readTxRx`` and cannot be exercised without opening a port,
which makes a mocked bus impossible to grade against a real one.

Protocol 2.0 packet shape (from the Robotis e-manual, `Protocol 2.0`_):

.. code-block:: text

    HEADER1  HEADER2  HEADER3  RESERVED  ID    LEN_L  LEN_H  INST    P1..PN    CRC_L  CRC_H
    0xFF     0xFF     0xFD     0x00      <id>  <n+3>          <n params>

- ``ID`` is 0..252 for a specific servo, ``0xFE`` for a broadcast that expects
  no reply.
- ``LEN`` is the count of the bytes that follow it up to and including the CRC
  (i.e. ``INST`` + params + CRC = ``N + 3`` where ``N`` is the parameter
  count).
- The CRC is CRC-16/BUYPASS (polynomial ``0x8005``, no reflection, init
  ``0x0000``, xor-out ``0x0000``) computed over the full frame from
  ``HEADER1`` through the last parameter byte.
- A payload may not contain the byte run ``FF FF FD``: a servo reading the bus
  would take it for the start of the next packet. Protocol 2.0 therefore
  *stuffs* an extra ``0xFD`` after any such run, and the ``LEN`` field counts
  the stuffed bytes. Stuffing happens BEFORE the CRC is taken, so the CRC
  covers the stuffed frame -- the order matters and is the one Robotis'
  ``txPacket`` uses. :func:`_stuff` and :func:`_unstuff` are the two halves;
  every builder here goes through them, and :func:`parse_status_packet`
  reverses them.

.. _Protocol 2.0: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/protocol2/

The status packet Robotis returns is the same shape with an ERR byte in front
of the parameters, so :func:`parse_status_packet` shares the frame check with
:func:`build_packet` and only differs in what it accepts after ``INST``.

Nothing here opens a serial port. The one function that would want the port -
``read_register`` say - is deliberately in the bus module (see :issue:`359`
scope 1) so this module can be imported on any host in CI.

    then counts the inserted bytes, so it is rewritten here.

    The exact inverse of :func:`_stuff`: a ``0xFD`` that follows a ``FF FF FD``
    run is an escape the servo inserted and is not part of the data.

    This is the one function in the module that is **not** a port of its
    ``dynamixel_sdk`` counterpart, and the divergence is deliberate. Robotis'
    ``removeStuffing`` compacts the packet in place, so its two-byte look-back
    reads buffer positions the same loop has already overwritten. On a payload
    carrying two reserved runs it therefore matches an ``FF FF`` that is not
    there and drops a data byte: ``FF FF FD FF FD FD`` survives this function
    unchanged and comes back from ``removeStuffing`` as ``FF FF FD FF FD``.

    What goes wrong there is the in-place compaction, not the choice of buffer:
    reading the emitted output (as below) and reading the untouched input are
    equivalent, because a stuffed payload still carries the run intact at the
    position being examined. Only a buffer the same loop is rewriting can
    answer with a byte that is no longer there. The round trip is therefore the
    adjudicator rather than parity with the SDK: an escape/unescape pair that
    is not the identity is broken whichever implementation is older.

    Do not "restore parity" by porting ``removeStuffing`` in. The invariant to
    preserve is that ``_unstuff`` recovers exactly what :func:`_stuff` was
    given, for every payload including one carrying two reserved runs - not
    agreement with the SDK, which does not hold that invariant itself.

def decode_model_number(params: bytes) -> int:
    """Decode a ``MODEL_NUMBER`` read's params.

    ``MODEL_NUMBER`` is a two-byte little-endian unsigned integer at register
    0, and every Protocol 2.0 servo reports it in its ``PING`` reply. That
    decode is wire format, so it belongs here.

    Resolving the number to a model name (``1060`` -> ``XL430-W250``) is
    deliberately *not* here. A name is per-model hardware metadata, checkable
    against a servo rather than against a byte string, so a table of names in
    this module can only be graded on its shape - upper-case, hyphenated,
    unique - and never on whether each name belongs to the number it sits
    against. That gap is not academic: this function has no error path for a
    *wrong* name, so one misassigned row reports an XL430-W250 as an
    XL330-M077 - a servo with roughly seven times less stall torque and a
    different voltage envelope - and the probe still looks like it succeeded.
    Silent hardware misidentification is a worse failure than no name at all,
    so name resolution lands with the bus that can read register 0 off real
    hardware and check itself (:issue:`359` scope 1).

    Args:
        params: The status packet's parameter bytes for a read of two bytes
            at register 0. Must be exactly two bytes.

    Returns:
        The model number, in ``0..0xFFFF``. An unrecognised number is not an
        error here: the caller still knows which servo answered and can refuse
        it by ID.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``params`` is not exactly two bytes.
