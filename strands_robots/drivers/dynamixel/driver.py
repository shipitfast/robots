"""Native Dynamixel Protocol 2.0 driver satisfying :class:`HardwareDriver`.

What this driver actually does today: it constructs, it satisfies the
:class:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.HardwareDriver` surface, and it names its
motion, task, and policy paths as deferred. It does **not** open a serial
port. The bus / serial I/O work is scope item 1 in :issue:`359` and is
deliberately its own PR - the same slice :issue:`354`'s triage recommends and
the same slice :issue:`360`'s triage explicitly names as landable-without-
hardware.

Why land it as a stub anyway: because the driver seam (:issue:`353` /
:pr:`2734`) is on ``main`` with no native driver registered against it for any
Dynamixel robot. ``Robot("koch", mode="real", driver="strands")`` today raises
``ValueError`` from :func:`~strands_robots.robot._build_native_driver` because
:func:`~strands_robots.drivers.registry.get_native_driver_class` returns
``None``. That error message says "add a driver package"; this file is the
smallest driver package that removes that failure mode without lying about
what works.

The surface a caller sees at each stub method is the shape it will hold when
the bus lands:

* ``send_action`` - refused with ``"not wired yet (the Protocol-2.0 serial
  bus)"``.
* ``start_task`` / ``run_policy`` - refused with the same envelope. There is
  no FSM to gate against on a servo bus (unlike the G1's ``mode_machine``),
  but a caller who plumbed error handling for the deferred G1 path gets to
  reuse it here.
* ``get_task_status`` / ``stop_task`` - return a live-but-empty envelope; the
  driver has no in-flight work to report while writes are deferred.
* ``cleanup`` - a no-op; there is nothing to release.

None of this pretends. Every stub returns an envelope of the same shape a
successful path would return, so the mesh and the agent do not need a code
change on the day the bus lands.

The class is registered for every Dynamixel robot the package registry knows
about - see :func:`~strands_robots.drivers._register_shipped_drivers` for the
list. Registering after import (``from strands_robots.drivers.dynamixel import
DynamixelDriver`` then :func:`register_native_driver`) is also supported and
is how an out-of-tree driver package would extend the table.
