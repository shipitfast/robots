"""use_unitree - a universal ``@tool`` wrapper around every Unitree SDK2 client.

Ported from ``cagataycali/neon-the-g1/tools/use_unitree.py`` (refs
strands-labs/robots#2928). ONE tool covers the entire unitree_sdk2_python
surface without a hand-written ``@tool`` per method - adding a new method
upstream requires no change here, because discovery is dynamic
(``inspect`` first, AST fallback for machines without the SDK).

Services (auto-discovered from the SDK):
    loco            unitree_sdk2py.g1.loco.g1_loco_client.LocoClient
    arm             unitree_sdk2py.g1.arm.g1_arm_action_client.G1ArmActionClient
    audio           unitree_sdk2py.g1.audio.g1_audio_client.AudioClient
    motion_switcher unitree_sdk2py.comm.motion_switcher.motion_switcher_client.MotionSwitcherClient
    vui             unitree_sdk2py.go2.vui.vui_client.VuiClient
    robot_state     unitree_sdk2py.go2.robot_state.robot_state_client.RobotStateClient

SDK-load hygiene: ``import strands_robots.tools.g1.use_unitree`` pulls no
``unitree_sdk2py`` submodule. Every SDK touch is inside a function body -
the meta operations (``list_services`` / ``list_operations`` /
``describe_operation``) fall back to AST-walking the SDK source when the
SDK cannot import (CI, dev boxes without cyclonedds), so discovery works
robot-free.

Client singletons: each SDK client is cached after first ``Init()``
because a second ``Init()`` on the same client class can crash the
process (the same rule :func:`~strands_robots.tools.g1._g1_common.ensure_dds`
serialises DDS factory construction for). ``Init()`` builds the client's
DDS request/response endpoints, so it runs under the *shared*
``_DDS_INIT_LOCK`` from :mod:`~strands_robots.tools.g1._g1_common` - the
same lock the driver and :mod:`~strands_robots.tools.g1._dds_engine` hold
while creating readers or writers, because concurrent endpoint
construction segfaults the CycloneDDS bindings. All RPC execution is
serialised on one further lock - the SDK clients are not thread-safe;
concurrent calls clobber each other's response futures and return
rc=3104.

Safety rails:
    * Mutative ops are decided by ALLOWLIST: a name is a read only when it is
      in ``READONLY_WHITELIST`` or is a ``Get*`` / ``Check*``; every other
      public verb - including one this module has never seen - is a write
      and is flagged in the response. A denylist here failed open on every
      SDK bump (F-001 follow-up).
    * ``HIGH_DANGER_OPS`` names the calls that can drop or walk the robot
      (ZeroTorque, SetFsmId, SetVelocity, Move, ReleaseMode, ...); those
      are flagged loudly in every response envelope - including the error
      envelope, where the flag is what says whether an unanswered command
      may still be executing.
    * Private SDK names (``_Call``, ``_CallNoReply``, ...) are refused rather
      than gated: they reach the same RPC as the typed methods without
      naming what they command, so no operator could approve one knowingly.
    * Every mutative or high-danger op stops for operator approval BEFORE
      the SDK RPC is dispatched, through the same decision path the ROS
      transports use (:func:`~strands_robots.tools._command_gate.gate_motion`):
      ``STRANDS_UNITREE_COMMAND_ALLOW`` (comma-separated ``service.operation``
      entries, or ``*``) pre-approves; ``BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true`` lifts the
      gate with a WARNING; otherwise the operator is prompted through the
      tool context, and with no context reachable the call is refused and
      nothing is sent. A log line is not an authorization control: before
      this gate an agent steered by untrusted content could walk the robot
      or drop its torque with only a warning in the log (F-001, CWE-862).
      Meta and read-only ops are never gated, and neither is
      ``loco.StopMove`` - stopping must never get harder.
    * Prefer the FSM-gated verbs (``g1_send_action``, ``g1_run_policy``,
      ``g1_set_stand_height``, ...) for routine motion - they route
      through :meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1.G1Driver._check_motion_gates`.
      ``use_unitree`` is the raw escape hatch.

    """Universal interface to every Unitree SDK2 client method.

    Like ``use_aws`` but for the Unitree G1. ONE tool covers the entire
    unitree_sdk2_python surface - no per-method @tool wrapper needed.

    SERVICES: loco (FSM/posture/walking), arm (gestures), audio (TTS/LED),
    motion_switcher (controller select), vui (head LED/volume),
    robot_state (service list/switch) - or 'meta' for discovery.

    META OPERATIONS (no DDS, no robot, always safe - use these first!):
      use_unitree('meta', 'list_services')
      use_unitree('meta', 'list_operations', {'service_name': 'loco'})
      use_unitree('meta', 'describe_operation',
                  {'service_name': 'loco', 'operation_name': 'SetFsmId'})

    HIGH-DANGER OPS (flagged in every response): loco.ZeroTorque (robot
    collapses), loco.SetFsmId (fsm_id=0 collapses), loco.SetVelocity /
    loco.Move (walking), motion_switcher.ReleaseMode (uncontrolled).
    Prefer the FSM-gated driver verbs (g1_send_action, g1_run_policy) for
    routine motion; use_unitree is the raw escape hatch.

    OPERATOR APPROVAL: every mutative op (and every high-danger op) stops
    for a human before the RPC is sent. Pre-approve with
    STRANDS_UNITREE_COMMAND_ALLOW=loco.SetVelocity,audio.TtsMaker (or '*');
    BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true lifts the gate. Reads, meta ops and
    loco.StopMove are never gated. The SDK's private plumbing (_Call,
    _CallNoReply, ...) is refused outright rather than gated - it reaches
    the same RPC as the typed methods without naming what it commands, so
    neither an operator nor the danger table can judge it. Name the typed
    operation instead.

    EXAMPLES:
      use_unitree('audio', 'TtsMaker', {'text': 'Hello', 'speaker_id': 0})
      use_unitree('audio', 'LedControl', {'R': 255, 'G': 0, 'B': 0})
      use_unitree('motion_switcher', 'CheckMode', {})
      use_unitree('loco', 'StopMove', {})   # emergency stop

    Args:
        service_name: One of {loco, arm, audio, motion_switcher, vui,
            robot_state} - or 'meta' for discovery operations.
        operation_name: PascalCase method name on the client class
            (e.g. 'SetFsmId', 'ExecuteAction', 'TtsMaker'), or one of
            {list_services, list_operations, describe_operation} when
            service_name='meta'.
        parameters: Kwargs to pass to the method. For meta ops, the
            lookup target (e.g. {'service_name': 'loco'}).
        label: Optional human-readable description, echoed in the response.
        network_interface: DDS interface. Default 'eth0'.
        tool_context: Supplied by the agent runtime; carries the operator
            interrupt the mutative ops are approved through. Without it a
            mutative op is refused unless pre-approved via
            STRANDS_UNITREE_COMMAND_ALLOW or BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true.

    Returns:
        Dict with status/message plus service, operation, label, result,
        mutative and high_danger flags. On error: the message plus
        available_operations or the expected signature where useful.

        The mutative and high_danger flags are present on BOTH outcomes,
        because a call that failed is the one whose classification a caller
        most needs. An RPC that times out is not evidence the command never
        landed - a loco.SetVelocity answering RPC_CLIENT_API_TIMEOUT is
        consistent with a robot that is walking - and an absent flag cannot be
        told apart from ``False``, so ``.get("high_danger")`` would read a
        failed ZeroTorque exactly like a failed GetFsmId.
