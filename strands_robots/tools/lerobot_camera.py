"""
LeRobot-based camera tool for Strands agents.
Leverages LeRobot's OpenCV and RealSense camera classes for professional camera management.

Every span this tool measures - a connect time, a per-frame capture time, a
recording's achieved duration - is a duration, so it is measured on
``time.monotonic()`` and its base carries that clock in its name
(``..._started_mono``). ``time.time()`` is not a clock but the current opinion
about the date, and an NTP correction, a ``date -s`` or a resume from suspend
landing inside one of these windows subtracts the step from the span. The
performance test then reads that span as a verdict about the camera (``Est.
FPS``, ``Fast``/``Slow``, ``Good``/``Slow``), so a corrected clock is reported
as a device measurement. The absolute stamps this tool writes - a filename's
date, a report's ``Timestamp`` line - are the other half of that boundary and
stay on ``datetime.now()``.

RealSense support needs the Intel SDK (``pyrealsense2``) in addition to lerobot,
which is what ``REALSENSE_AVAILABLE`` reports; importing lerobot's RealSense
camera classes does not establish it, because lerobot requires the SDK at its
call sites rather than at import. Every surface that reports the SDK absent
names the same install, :data:`REALSENSE_SDK_ABSENT`.

    These three select a *posture* rather than scaling a quantity, and each was
    read by truthiness - so every non-empty string, the spellings a caller
    reaches for when opting out included, selected the affirmative posture.
    Measured on ``eecaa80`` against a recording camera stand-in:

    * ``save_config="false"`` wrote the configuration file, so a caller who
      spelled the opt-out got a durable artifact on disk under
      ``status="success"``;
    * ``warmup="false"`` was handed to ``Camera.connect`` as the string, was
      persisted into that file as ``"warmup": "false"`` - a string in the one
      field of that document declared a boolean, beside the integer geometry and
      rate that are validated - and was reported on the line above it as
      ``Warmup: on``, so the file, the report and the caller disagree three ways
      about one posture;
    * ``async_mode="false"`` selected the asynchronous read path, which the
      plain boolean ``False`` does not: one ``async_read`` and no synchronous
      read, against zero and one.

    It runs ahead of :func:`_numeric_option_error` because that guard's
    ``timeout_ms`` row is *gated* on this flag - the synchronous read consumes no
    budget, so an option no handler reads is not refused. Reading the gate by
    truthiness switched the row off from outside its own table: ``async_mode=0``
    with ``timeout_ms=-5`` was answered ``status="success"``, an unusable budget
    accepted because a falsy value that is not a declared spelling of *off*
    discarded the row. Ordered the other way the refusal also names the wrong
    parameter - ``async_mode="false", timeout_ms=-5`` reported ``capture:
    timeout_ms must be > 0``, sending the caller to correct a budget whose only
    problem was the flag that selected it.

    Keyed by action, and holding only the flags each handler is actually passed,
    for the reason the numeric table is: ``discover`` and ``list`` take none of
    the three, so a value neither consults is not refused. The domain itself
    belongs to neither surface, so it delegates to
    :func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error` - the one owner the sibling
    ``lerobot_train`` builder already consults - exactly as the numeric rows
    delegate their spans and counts. What stays here is the
    roster and the report order, which puts ``save_config`` ahead of ``warmup``
    so the flag that writes a file is named before the one that only opens a
    camera.

    Args:

    Every value here is agent-supplied, so each is checked against the shared

    count pixels and frames
    (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_whole_number_error`, which already owns
    the recorders' geometry and rate), while the two durations and ``timeout_ms``
    are continuous spans of time
    (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_finite_number_error`). Reusing those
    helpers is what keeps this tool from accepting a frame size or a rate that the
    plain-MP4 recorders refuse.

    Validating here rather than letting the camera driver object is what makes the
    refusal a property of the request instead of the device: the driver compares
    the rate it was asked for against the rate the attached camera reports, so its
    complaint names an ``actual_fps`` and is only raised once the device has been
    opened and reconfigured. A rate of ``0`` is impossible on every camera, and the
    tool has its own stake in these values regardless of the device - ``fps`` is
    written into the MP4 container as its timebase and is the divisor of the
    preview's frame period.

    ``timeout_ms`` is only effective under ``async_mode``: the synchronous read
    takes no timeout, so a value it never consumes is not refused. That makes the
    flag a gate on this table, so it is a boolean by the time it is read here -
    :func:`_posture_flag_error` runs first, and a truthy spelling of *off* can no
    longer switch the row off from outside the table.

    **The frame count is a product, so one factor's sign does not decide whether a
    frame can be captured.** ``positive_finite_number_error`` reads
    ``capture_duration`` alone, and at the default ``fps=30`` every span below
    ``0.0333`` is positive, finite, and makes the recording loop's bound
    ``int(fps * capture_duration) == 0`` - the loop body never runs, and the tool
    reports ``status="success"`` with ``Frames: 0`` while its ``Saved:`` line names
    the same 258-byte MP4 that no decoder will open. Which side of the line a span
    falls on is not a property of the span, so the rate is read with it. Refused
    rather than floored to one frame: a recording that cannot be honored as asked
    is a caller error, not a value to silently substitute. ``preview_duration`` is
    deliberately not paired with ``fps`` this way - the preview is bounded by a
    ``time.monotonic()`` deadline whose first iteration always runs, so a short
    preview displays a frame rather than none.

    though, neither of these is ever refused downstream - each names a closed

    spelling resolved to a *plausible neighbour* instead of failing: anything other
    than ``RGB`` selected ``BGR``, and any rotation the map did not name selected
    ``NO_ROTATION``. Both substitutions reported success.

    That is what makes the substitution expensive rather than merely wrong. A
    ``color_mode`` the driver reads as ``BGR`` is delivered in that channel order,
    and the capture path converts the frame it is handed with ``COLOR_RGB2BGR``
    unconditionally, so the saved image has its red and blue channels transposed -
    a photograph of a red object is written blue - while the result says

    Args:
        action: Action to perform
            - "discover": Discover all available cameras (OpenCV + RealSense)
            - "list": List camera details and configurations
            - "capture": Capture single image from camera
            - "capture_batch": Capture from multiple cameras simultaneously
            - "record": Record video sequence from camera
            - "preview": Show live preview from camera
            - "test": Test camera functionality and performance
            - "configure": Configure camera settings and save
        camera_type: Camera type ("opencv" or "realsense"). "realsense" needs
            the Intel SDK installed on top of lerobot; without it the action is
            refused naming that install, rather than reported as unsupported.
        camera_id: Camera device ID (int for index, str for path like "/dev/video0")
        save_path: Directory to save captured images/videos
        filename: Custom filename (without extension). Resolved inside
            save_path; a value naming a location outside it is refused rather
            than written there.
        camera_ids: Cameras to capture from in one capture_batch call - a list
            of distinct ids, each an int index or a device path string. Omit it
            for the default robot cameras. An empty list selects no camera and
            is refused rather than widened to those defaults; a single id passed
            as a bare string is refused rather than read one camera per character.
        width: Frame width in pixels (a positive whole number)
        height: Frame height in pixels (a positive whole number)
        fps: Frames per second (a positive whole number)
        color_mode: Color mode; one of "RGB" or "BGR", compared case-insensitively.
            Any other value is refused rather than silently read as "BGR".
        rotation: Image rotation; one of "NO_ROTATION", "ROTATE_90", "ROTATE_180"
            or "ROTATE_270", compared case-insensitively. Any other value is
            refused rather than silently read as "NO_ROTATION".
        format: Image format ("jpg", "png", "bmp"). Becomes the saved file's
            extension, so like filename it is resolved inside save_path and
            refused if it names a location outside it. The image returned
            alongside the file is encoded as JPEG only for a JPEG request; any
            other format is carried back losslessly as PNG, so the inline copy
            has the frame's own pixels.
        capture_duration: Duration for video recording (positive seconds)
        preview_duration: Duration for preview display (positive seconds)
        async_mode: Use async reading for better performance. A boolean; it
            selects a read path rather than scaling one, so any other value is
            refused rather than read as its opposite.
        timeout_ms: Timeout for async operations (positive milliseconds; read only when async_mode is on)
        warmup: Enable camera warmup on connection. A boolean, refused rather
            than read by truthiness - it is also recorded in the saved
            configuration, so a non-boolean would persist there.
        save_config: Save camera configuration to file. A boolean, refused
            rather than read by truthiness: it writes a file, so a truthy
            spelling of off would leave one behind.

    Returns:
