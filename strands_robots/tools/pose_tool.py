Robot Pose Management Tool

This tool provides comprehensive pose management for robotic arms, including:
- Storing and retrieving named poses
- Fine-grained motor control with small incremental movements
- Safety checks and validation
- Integration with LeRobot and serial communication
- Pose interpolation and smooth transitions
- Framed decoding of servo status replies

Operator approval: the five actions that move the arm - ``move_motor``,
``move_multiple``, ``incremental_move``, ``load_pose`` and ``reset_to_home`` -
stop for a human BEFORE the :class:`MotorController` is built, through the same
decision path the ROS transports, ``use_unitree`` and ``serial_tool`` use
(:func:`~strands_robots.tools._command_gate.gate_motion`).
``STRANDS_POSE_COMMAND_ALLOW`` (comma-separated action names, or ``*``)
pre-approves, ``BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true`` lifts the gate with a WARNING,
otherwise the operator is prompted through the tool context and, with none
reachable, the call is refused and no packet is written. The dashboard's
:class:`~strands_robots.dashboard.agent_hitl.MotionInterruptHook` lists the same
five actions; when that hook has already asked and deposited a grant for this
exact call the in-tool gate spends the grant instead of asking twice. Before
this gate the hook was the only human check, and it is a hook an ``Agent`` has
to be built with - every canonical ``Agent(tools=robot.tools)`` build had none,
so the default wiring moved the arm unasked (F-010, CWE-862). ``connect``,
``read_position``, ``read_all``, the pose library actions (``store_pose``,
``list_poses``, ``show_pose``, ``delete_pose``) and ``emergency_stop`` are never
gated: stopping is never gated.

    quantity: interpolate over ``steps * step_delay`` seconds, or write each
    goal position once. Read by truthiness, the two undeclared halves fail in
    opposite directions and neither reports itself.

    A falsy non-boolean - ``0``, ``""``, ``None``, ``[]`` - takes the one-shot
    branch, and the flag defaults to ``True``, so it silently *removes* the
    interpolation a caller never asked to leave. What arrives at the servo is a
    single write to the far end of the travel: the full-travel jump this module
    already refuses ``steps=True`` for, on the grounds that it is "exactly the
    path a caller asking to interpolate wanted to avoid". Every non-empty string
    is truthy, so the opt-out spellings ``"false"``, ``"no"``, ``"off"`` and
    ``"0"`` select the *interpolating* branch instead - and, because this flag
    also decides whether ``steps`` and ``step_delay`` are read at all, the
    caller is then refused for one of those options while believing they had
    spelled nobody reading them.

    It is checked only for the actions that consult it, matching
    :func:`_smooth_move_option_error`: ``reset_to_home`` interpolates
    unconditionally and passes its own ``smooth=True``, and every other action
    moves in one shot, so neither reads the caller's flag and neither may be
    refused for it.

    The check is ordered ahead of :func:`_smooth_move_option_error` so a bad
    flag is named as the flag. Behind it, the refusal names ``steps`` or
    ``step_delay`` - sending the caller to correct a value whose only problem
    was the posture that decided it would be read.

    Both options are consumed inside the interpolation loop, on a live servo
    bus: ``steps`` divides the travel into increments and bounds the loop, and
    ``step_delay`` is the pause between successive goal positions. Their product
    is the trajectory's duration, so neither has a usable value outside its
    domain and each fails in its own way if one is not applied.

    ``steps`` is checked against
    :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error`: it is a divisor and a

    makes the loop body unreachable and reports a move that never happened, and

    is refused with it, because ``True`` is a silent single increment - a
    full-travel jump on exactly the path a caller asking to interpolate wanted
    to avoid.

    ``step_delay`` is checked against
    :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_finite_number_error` - the same domain
    the library's other pacing knobs use - and that includes refusing ``0``. The
    pause *is* the smoothing: with no pause the increments are written as fast as
    the bus accepts them (a six-motor 20-step move is ~126 short writes, on the

          raises only after a prefix of the new document has replaced the old
          one on disk.
        * :func:`os.replace` is atomic within a directory, so a full disk or an
          I/O error during the commit leaves the previous library intact rather
          than truncated, and a concurrent reader observes one whole document
          or the other, never a prefix.

        The temp file is written with :meth:`pathlib.Path.write_text` rather

# sum :meth:`MotorController.build_feetech_packet` writes on the way out.
#
# The reply cannot be read at fixed offsets. The bus is half-duplex and shared by
# every servo on the arm, so what comes back may carry a leading byte the host's
# own transmission echoed, or the late answer to a read that already timed out,
# sent by a different motor. Indexing straight into the buffer turns either of
# those into a position that is wrong rather than missing: a single leading byte
# shifts the two position bytes by one, which reports a joint ninety degrees from
# where it is and offers nothing to say the number is not a measurement.
#
# So the frame is located and verified instead. This mirrors the vendor SDK,
# which is the authority for the wire format: ``scservo_sdk``'s ``rxPacket``
# searches for the header, re-derives the frame length from ``LEN`` and verifies
# the checksum, and its ``txRxPacket`` keeps reading until the responding ID
# matches the one that was asked. Recovering the frame rather than refusing the

    Advanced robot pose management tool with fine motor control.

    Actions:
        Pose Management:
        - "store_pose": Store current robot pose with a name
        - "load_pose": Move robot to a stored pose
        - "list_poses": List all stored poses
        - "delete_pose": Delete a stored pose
        - "show_pose": Display pose information

        Motor Control:
        - "move_motor": Move single motor to position
        - "move_multiple": Move multiple motors simultaneously
        - "incremental_move": Small incremental motor movement
        - "read_position": Read current motor position
        - "read_all": Read all motor positions

        System:
        - "connect": Test robot connection
        - "emergency_stop": De-energize every motor (Torque_Enable=0). The arm
          goes LIMP and falls under gravity -- it does not hold position, so
          anything it is grasping is dropped. Reports an error when any motor
          could not be released.
        - "reset_to_home": Move to safe home position

    Calibration:
        This tool performs no calibration - every action above drives or reads a
        motor through the calibration already on disk. Recording one is
        LeRobot's own procedure, run from the shell with ``lerobot-calibrate``
        (after ``lerobot-find-port`` and ``lerobot-setup-motors``), which writes
        the JSON under ``HF_LEROBOT_CALIBRATION``; the interactive prompt
        LeRobot shows when a device has none is answered by a
        ``lerobot_teleoperate`` session's ``auto_accept_calibration``.

    Args:
        action: Action to perform
        robot_id: Robot identifier for pose storage. Becomes part of the pose
            file's name, so a value resolving outside the storage directory is
            refused rather than written there.
        port: Serial port for robot communication
        pose_name: Name for pose operations
        motor_name: Motor name for single motor operations
        position: Target position in degrees (or 0-100% for gripper). A finite
            number within the motor's configured travel - a value outside it is
            refused rather than clamped to the mechanical limit, because the
            clamp cannot be told apart from a typo and the success text echoes
            the value asked for.
        delta: Incremental movement in degrees. A finite number whose magnitude
            is at most the motor's full travel, which no starting position could
            exceed.
        positions: Dictionary of motor positions {motor_name: degrees}. Every
            value is held to the same domain as ``position``, and the first that
            is not names the motor it came from.
        description: Description for stored poses
        smooth: Interpolate towards the targets over ``steps * step_delay``
            seconds instead of writing each goal position once. A boolean:
            it selects one of two trajectories, so a value that is only
            truthy or only falsy is refused rather than read as one of
            them - ``smooth=0`` would drop the interpolation this defaults
            to, and ``smooth="false"`` would keep it. Read only by
            ``load_pose`` and ``move_multiple``.
        steps: Number of increments for an interpolated move. A positive
            integer - it divides the travel and bounds the write loop.
        step_delay: Seconds between increments of an interpolated move. A
            positive finite number - this pause is what makes the move smooth,
            so ``0`` is refused; use ``smooth=False`` to go straight to the
            target. Together with ``steps`` it sets the trajectory duration
            (the default 20 x 0.05s = ~1s).
        tool_context: Supplied by the agent runtime; carries the operator
            interrupt the motion actions are approved through. Without it a
            motion is refused unless pre-approved via
            STRANDS_POSE_COMMAND_ALLOW or BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true

    Operator approval:
        "move_motor", "move_multiple", "incremental_move", "load_pose" and
        "reset_to_home" move the arm, so each stops for a human before the
        motor controller is built; a declined or headless call sends no goal
        position. Pre-approve with STRANDS_POSE_COMMAND_ALLOW=move_motor,load_pose
        (or "*"). "connect", the reads, the pose library actions and
        "emergency_stop" are never gated.

    Both interpolation options are read only by ``load_pose`` and
    ``move_multiple`` (when ``smooth`` is left true) and by ``reset_to_home``,
    which always interpolates; any other action ignores them and is never
    refused for them. ``smooth`` itself is read only by the first two -
    ``reset_to_home`` supplies its own - so only those two are refused for it.

    Returns:
        Dict containing status and response content, or an error dict when an
        interpolation option or a joint target the requested action reads cannot
        be honored.
