"""Confirmation that a signalled session process has actually exited.

A tool that stops a background session sends a signal and then has to answer a
separate question: did the process go away? Sending SIGKILL is not the answer.
The kernel delivers it asynchronously, and a task inside an uninterruptible
wait - a serial ioctl on a teleoperation bus, a stalled CUDA or network call in
a training step - stays in the process table until that wait returns. A stop
that reports success on the strength of having *sent* the signal tells the
caller the arm is released and the GPU is free when neither may be true.

:func:`confirm_exit` is that answer and :func:`unstopped_result` is the report
for when it is not affirmative, shared by every session ``stop`` verb so the
rule is stated once rather than per verb.

The other half of the same question is which process is being asked about. A pid
is not a name: the kernel hands the number back out once the process holding it
exits, so a session record that outlives its run points at whatever holds the
number next. Answering "is it running" from the pid alone therefore reports a
stranger as the session, and the ``stop`` verb that verdict invites signals it.
:func:`session_is_running` is that answer, and it needs the identity
:func:`confirm_exit` already insists on - captured before the question is asked,
because a freshly constructed :class:`psutil.Process` captures the identity it is
being asked to check and so cannot contradict it.

Before either question can be asked there is the number itself, and it arrives
from a JSON file rather than from a caller. :func:`recorded_pid` is the one
reader of it, because converting instead of grading is how a record comes to
name a process it was never written for: ``int(4321.5)`` is a pid the record does
not carry, and ``int(True)`` is pid 1.

The same is true of every other field the record carries, and the one a report
reads is ``start_time``. :func:`session_uptime` is its one reader, for the same
reason: subtracting an ungraded stamp from the clock turns a record that states
no usable start into a duration - the ``0`` an absent key defaults to renders as
the whole epoch, a little under fifty-seven years - and reports it beside a
running flag that is correct.

One store holds every robot session, because the tools that start them are
peers: a detached teleoperation run and a detached training run are two entries
in one file, and either tool's ``list`` shows both. :class:`SessionManager` is
that file's one reader and writer for the same reason :func:`recorded_pid` is
the one reader of a pid. Two readers of one document cannot hold two retention
policies: whichever of them deletes a record deletes it for the other as well,
so the destructive policy is the one that takes effect and the retaining one's
guarantee is not the store's, only its own.

Reading a record presupposes that the file still holds one, which is what
:func:`store_sessions` is for. Every session store here is a whole document: a
verb that starts or stops one session loads every record, changes that one, and
writes them all back. A write that lands partially therefore does not lose the
session being changed, it loses every session the file held - and the load path
reports an unparseable store as *no sessions*, so the loss surfaces as an arm
that is still being driven by a process no verb can name.

    The read-side owner of the record's ``start_time``, in the shape
    :func:`recorded_pid` uses for its ``pid``: the value, or the absence of one -
    never a number derived from a stamp that is not one. It answers for both
    consumers of that span in one read of the clock, so a report's ``Uptime``
    line and the ``uptime`` its ``json`` block carries cannot disagree.

    ``start_time`` is a wall-clock stamp, so the span is measured against
    :func:`time.time` rather than :func:`time.monotonic`: the record is written
    by one process and read by another, and a monotonic reading is a duration
    since this machine booted, which the reading process cannot relate to the
    writer's. That is also why a stamp cannot simply be trusted - the clock it
    was taken from is the current opinion about the date, and an NTP correction
    or a ``date -s`` between the write and the read moves the span by the step.
    A step large enough to put the stamp in this clock's future is reported as
    such rather than as a negative duration, which is what the subtraction
    renders on its own.

    The values refused are the ones a JSON file produces and the subtraction
    does not survive:

    * No ``start_time`` at all, and the ``null`` that says the same thing. Both
      default to ``0`` in the arithmetic, and ``time.time() - 0`` is the epoch:
      a session started minutes ago reads as one running since 1970.
    * ``bool``, which is an ``int`` subclass, so ``true`` is one second past the
      epoch and lands within a second of the same answer.
    * A ``str``, a ``list`` or a ``dict``. ``time.time() - "1788000000"`` raises
      ``TypeError``, and ``float()`` of that same string does not, so the two
      verbs of one tool reach opposite conclusions about one record.
    * ``NaN`` and the infinities, which ``json.load`` produces from a well-formed
      file and which render as ``nan min`` and ``-inf min``.
    * Any stamp at or before the epoch, because ``0`` is the value the absent
      case used to default to and accepting it re-creates that report.

    What is *not* refused is a positive stamp that is merely implausible: ``1``
    is one second past the epoch and is measured as the span it states. The
    boundary is deliberate, because the only non-arbitrary floor available is
    this machine's boot time, and that is not a safe one to compare against - on
    Linux it comes from the ``btime`` recorded in ``/proc/stat`` at boot, which a
    later correction to the clock does not revise, so a backwards correction
    leaves a genuine post-boot stamp reading as earlier than boot. This owner
    grades what a value *is*, not whether a plausible clock produced it.
