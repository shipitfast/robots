    Looks up the robot in ``registry/robots.json``, then searches
    the asset directories for the actual file.  If no XML is found, or a mesh the
    model DECLARES is absent, downloads the asset via ``robot_descriptions``
    before returning - unless ``allow_download`` declines.

    Mesh presence is read from the model's declarations, resolved against its
    ``<compiler meshdir>`` the way MuJoCo resolves them, so a model whose meshes
    live outside its own directory is not mistaken for one that has none.

    ``allow_download=False`` makes this a pure filesystem lookup: no network, no
    ``robot_descriptions`` import. Within the curated registry it is exactly
    equivalent to a download that declines, so it cannot change the answer for an
    asset already on disk - an absent XML still returns ``None`` and an XML whose
    declared mesh is absent still returns its first candidate, the same two
    outcomes a failed download produces today.

    It declines the discovery fallback too, so a name only
    :mod:`strands_robots.registry.discovery` could synthesize an entry for reports
    a miss instead of importing a description module to find out. That import is
    itself the fetch - ``robot_descriptions`` calls ``clone_to_cache`` at module
    scope - so consulting discovery clones the upstream asset repository on a cold
    cache, including on the miss path where the answer is ``None`` either way.

    Prefer it in any caller that reports on assets rather than loading them.
    :func:`is_robot_asset_present` answers *whether* an asset is on disk without a
