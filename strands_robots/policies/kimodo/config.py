"""KimodoConfig - configuration for the Kimodo text-to-motion diffusion policy.

Kimodo (``nvidia/Kimodo-G1-RP-v1``) is a text-conditioned kinematic motion
diffusion model: prompt in, per-frame G1 ``qpos`` out. This module captures the
knobs a user cares about (prompt, sampling steps, guidance, FPS, and the HF
model id) as a frozen :class:`KimodoConfig` dataclass so a bad value surfaces
at construction time with a clear message rather than deep inside the sampler.

Numeric domains follow the shared helpers in :mod:`strands_robots.utils`:

* ``diffusion_steps`` - positive integer (Kimodo default 100, 25-200 useful
  range) bounded by :data:`_KIMODO_MAX_DIFFUSION_STEPS`, via
  :func:`diffusion_steps_error`, which is also the domain
  :meth:`KimodoPolicy.get_actions` applies to a per-call override
* ``guidance_scale`` - positive finite number (Kimodo default 7.5), the shared
  :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_finite_number_error` domain, which
  :meth:`KimodoPolicy.get_actions` applies to a per-call override too
* ``fps`` - positive integer (Kimodo emits at 30Hz native, upsampled to 50Hz
  for the G1 tracker via SLERP downstream)
* ``num_frames`` - positive integer bounded by the model's max sequence length
  (196 for RP-v1)
* ``transition_frames`` - positive integer, at least 1, matching the domain the
  Kimodo sampler applies to its own ``num_transition_frames``
* ``seed`` - whole number or ``None``, via :func:`sampling_seed_error`, which is
  also the domain :meth:`KimodoPolicy.reset` applies to a per-episode reseed and
  :meth:`KimodoPolicy.get_actions` to a per-call override

The default ``model_id`` targets the RP-v1 checkpoint. Alternate model ids are
accepted verbatim; the loader defers validation to ``from_pretrained``. Note
that ``nvidia/Kimodo-G1-RP-v1`` publishes bare weights rather than a diffusers
pipeline, so a real-model run supplies its sampler through ``motion_agent=``.

    The step count is spent twice, and both uses are why the domain is not
    merely advisory. It is handed to the sampler, where it is the number of
    denoising iterations - ``0`` asks for a sample that was never denoised and
    ``True`` asks for one iteration, neither of which is a motion a tracker
    should be asked to follow. And it is part of the key

    The single owner of this domain. Three surfaces set the sampling seed -

    documented per-call ``seed=`` override is read straight from ``kwargs`` and
    reaches both the sampler and the buffered-motion key without passing
    through the config at all. All three consult this function, so one value
    gets one verdict whichever way it is spelled.

    A seed has to survive being used twice, and that is what the domain here
    protects. It is handed to the sampler, and it is part of the key
    ``KimodoPolicy`` identifies the buffered motion by - a key built by
    coercing the seed with ``int()``. A seed that is not already whole
    therefore names a different sample than the one it produces: ``2.5`` and
    ``2.9`` reach the sampler as themselves and key as ``2``, so a reseeded
    episode reads as a cache hit and silently replays the previous episode's
    motion rather than sampling its own. ``nan`` and ``inf`` do not survive
    the coercion at all and raised out of the key builder - past the
    construction-time reporting this module exists to give, and on a rollout
    that had already reported the reseed as applied. ``inf`` is reachable from
    a JSON config file: ``1e400`` is well-formed JSON and parses to it.

    ``bool`` is rejected explicitly. It is an ``int`` subclass, so ``True``
    would pass an integrality test and then key as ``1``, silently sharing a
    motion with ``seed=1``.

    Sign is not part of this domain. Kimodo's seed is applied with
    ``torch.manual_seed`` (or a ``Generator``'s), which honors a negative seed,
    and the key holds it unchanged - so a negative seed round-trips, and
    refusing it would reject a value that works. The rollout facades'
    :func:`~strands_robots.simulation.base.randomization_seed_error` is
    narrower for the reason it states itself: it also reseeds ``numpy.random``,
    which refuses a negative seed and a value above ``2**32 - 1``. Their
    appliers are not equally wide, so their domains are not either.

    Magnitude is not part of it either, and the distinction is where the
    failure surfaces. Both torch appliers accept ``[-2**63, 2**64-1]`` and
    refuse a wider seed with a ``ValueError`` naming the overflow, at the call
    that applies it - so an outsized seed is already reported, by the applier
    that owns the bound, and the sampler is a pluggable ``motion_agent=`` whose
    bound is not this module's to state. What this function refuses is the
    complementary set: seeds that fail somewhere nobody is looking - inside a
    private key builder, with no mention of a seed - or that do not fail at
    all and simply name the wrong sample.

    Args:
        value: The candidate seed (``None`` selects fresh entropy per call).

class KimodoConfig:
    """Frozen configuration for :class:`KimodoPolicy`.

    Attributes:
        model_id: HuggingFace model id. Defaults to ``nvidia/Kimodo-G1-RP-v1``.
        diffusion_steps: Number of denoising steps (25-200, default 100).
        guidance_scale: Classifier-free-guidance weight (default 7.5).
        num_frames: Motion length in Kimodo native frames (30 FPS, max 196).
        transition_frames: Number of native frames over which a newly sampled
            motion is eased off the pose last commanded, when a prompt (or any
            other sampler input) changes mid-rollout. A fresh sample begins at
            its own canonical start pose, which is unrelated to wherever the
            previous motion left the robot, so emitting it directly steps every
            joint at once. Defaults to 5, the same length Kimodo's sampler uses
            for its own ``num_transition_frames``. Only the first sample of a
            rollout is unaffected: with no previously commanded pose there is no
            seam to ease.
        native_fps: Kimodo sampler output rate (30 Hz native, do not change
            unless targeting a retrained checkpoint).
        tracker_fps: Rate the G1 tracker consumes at (50 Hz standard). Frames
            are SLERP-interpolated from ``native_fps`` to ``tracker_fps`` by
            :class:`KimodoPolicy`.
        device: torch device string (``"cuda"``, ``"cuda:0"``, ``"cpu"``).
            ``None`` means auto-select CUDA if available.
        dtype: Sampler dtype string. ``"fp16"`` recommended on GPU for speed;
            ``"fp32"`` for reproducibility.
        cache_dir: Optional local HF cache override; ``None`` uses
            ``$HF_HOME``.
        trust_remote_code: Whether ``from_pretrained`` may execute code that
            ships inside the checkpoint repository. Defaults to ``False``, so
            loading a checkpoint does not run its code unless the caller asks
            for it. ``STRANDS_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE`` is a separate and coarser
            gate: it decides whether this provider may be constructed at all
            and never sets this field, so opting in to the provider does not
            also opt in to executing a repository's code. Only a ``model_id``
            published in diffusers pipeline layout reaches the flag at all -
            NVIDIA's own Kimodo checkpoints are not, and are refused at load
            time in favour of a ``motion_agent=`` sampler. It selects a
            posture rather than scaling a quantity, so a non-boolean is
            refused at construction (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error`)
            rather than forwarded: ``from_pretrained`` reads the flag by
            truthiness, and ``"false"`` - the spelling a JSON ``policy_config``
            reaches for to opt out - is truthy, so it would run the
            checkpoint's code for the caller who asked it not to.
        seed: RNG seed for reproducible sampling. A whole number, of either
            sign and any width, or ``None`` for fresh entropy on every sample.
            :func:`sampling_seed_error` owns the domain and
