        :meth:`set_robot_state_keys`, with the compiled ``MjModel`` and the
        robot's namespace prefix (``"so100/"``). The mock's ±0.5 rad sinusoid
        was written for a generic joint; on a real model some actuators do not
        span it - the SO-100 ``Pitch`` ctrlrange is ``[-3.32, 0.174]`` and its
        ``Jaw`` is ``[-0.174, 1.75]`` - so MuJoCo clamped the value and the
        engine warned that the commanded trajectory was NOT reproduced. That
        warning was the first thing ``examples/01_sim_hello_world.py`` printed.
        Knowing the ranges, the mock clips its own output so what it commands
        is what the actuator does. Unlimited actuators and names that resolve
        to no actuator are left alone; an error while reading the model leaves
        the policy exactly as configured, never fails the rollout.
