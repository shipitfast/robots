"""Configuration + YAML loader for the ProtoMotions Generalist Tracking Policy.

The upstream ONNX artifact
(``cagataydev/protomotions-gtp-unitree-g1/unified_pipeline.onnx``) ships with a
YAML sidecar (``unified_pipeline.yaml``) that pins:

* The 29 joint names in the ONNX action order.
* The 33 body names + anchor index (``torso_link`` = 16) + root index
  (``pelvis`` = 0).
* Per-joint stiffness + damping.
* Timing: ``control_dt = 0.02s`` (50Hz), ``physics_dt = 0.001s`` (1kHz),
  ``decimation = 20``.
* The future-reference lookahead schedule ``[1, 2, 4, 8]`` control steps.

:class:`ProtoMotionsConfig` is the typed dataclass representation of that
sidecar. Loading it once at construction (rather than reading the YAML on every
tick) means the hot path never touches disk, and a dimension or joint-count
error surfaces at policy build time with a clean message.

class ProtoMotionsConfig:
    """Frozen typed view of the ONNX ``unified_pipeline.yaml`` sidecar.

    All fields have upstream-verified defaults matching the shipped
    ``cagataydev/protomotions-gtp-unitree-g1`` weights. A caller that points at
    a different checkpoint should always pair it with a matching config.

    Attributes:
        joint_names: 29 joint names in ONNX action order.
        body_names: 33 body names in the model's rigid-body order.
        anchor_body_index: Row index of the anchor body inside ``body_names``.
        root_body_index: Row index of the root body inside ``body_names``.
        stiffness: Per-joint kp used by the deployed PD loop.
        damping: Per-joint kd used by the deployed PD loop.
        control_dt: Seconds per outer control tick, a positive finite number.
            This is the period the reference motion is RESAMPLED onto by
            :class:`~strands_robots.policies.protomotions.motion_utils.MotionPlayer`,
            so it fixes how many frames one clip becomes, and the playhead
            advances exactly one of those frames per tick.
        physics_dt: Seconds per inner physics substep. Carried for provenance;
            no reader in this package consumes it.
        decimation: Physics substeps per control tick (``control_dt /
            physics_dt``). Carried for provenance; no reader in this package
            consumes it, and the stated relation is not checked against the two
            periods.
        future_step_indices: Future-reference lookahead offsets in control
            steps.
        action_ema_alpha: Exponential-moving-average smoothing applied to the
            joint targets the PD loop receives, in ``(0, 1]``. ``1.0`` (the
            upstream default) is passthrough; a smaller value weights the
            previous target more heavily, trading tracking lag for less
            per-tick jitter. Applied by
            :meth:`~strands_robots.policies.protomotions.policy.\
ProtoMotionsPolicy.get_actions`; the raw network output continues to feed the
            historical-actions buffer, which is what the ONNX graph's
            ``historical_processed_actions`` input is defined over.
        onnx_in_names: Input tensor names in the order the exported session
            declares them, so the session's ``get_inputs()`` order can be
            validated against this tuple at load.
        onnx_out_names: Output tensor names requested from the session. Outputs
            are paired to these names rather than by position, so a config that
            declares the checkpoint's outputs in a different order still reads
            the right tensor.
        metadata: Free-form provenance carried alongside the config, populated
            from a sidecar's own ``metadata`` key. Never read by the control
            path.

        """Refuse a body index, a smoothing factor or a control period no reader can honor.

        The two indices are the only fields this config resolves a body NAME
        from, and an index that misses is not a value the control path can
        report: :attr:`anchor_body_name` and :attr:`root_body_name` index a
        tuple, so a negative index silently names a real but different link,
        and the tracker then anchors on it consistently -
        :attr:`~strands_robots.policies.base.Policy.required_bodies` declares
        that link, the runtime supplies its quaternion, and the future-reference
        window reads the same row. Every stage agrees, and every stage is wrong.

        Each index goes through the shared whole-number domain BEFORE the
        ``int()`` normalisation, not after: that conversion is what laundered a
        yaml ``anchor_body_index: true`` into row 1 (``head``) and a ``2.7``
        into row 2 (``left_hip_pitch_link``).

        :attr:`action_ema_alpha` is gated for the same reason and against the
        same failure: the value is the weight the CURRENT network output carries
        in the target the PD loop receives, so ``0`` weights it not at all and
        freezes the commanded pose at the first tick's target for the whole
        clip - a tracker that reports every frame and moves through none of
        them. A negative weight drives the joint the opposite way from the
        motion it is tracking, one above ``1`` over-extrapolates past it, and
        ``nan`` propagates into the filter state and never leaves it, so every
        joint of every later tick is ``nan`` however good the network output
        is. None of the four is a smoothing factor, and all four used to be
        stored and carried into the control path.

        :attr:`control_dt` is gated for the same reason, and it is the one field
        of the timing block the control path SPENDS: it is the period the
        reference motion is resampled onto, so it decides how many frames one
        clip becomes, and the playhead advances one frame per tick. A period of
        ``1.0`` - what a sidecar's ``control_dt: true`` resolved to - resamples a
        3-second clip to 4 frames, so two of the tracker's four lookahead
        offsets read past the end from the first tick; a negative period and
        ``inf`` each collapse the clip to a SINGLE frame, which the frame clamp
        then serves for every tick of the episode - a tracker that reports a
        motion and holds one pose. ``0`` left the period undefined, and ``nan``
        reached the resampler to raise there instead, naming neither the field
        nor the sidecar it came from. All five used to be stored.

        :attr:`physics_dt` and :attr:`decimation` are deliberately NOT gated: no
        reader in this package consumes either, so refusing a value would change
        which sidecars load with no behaviour to protect - a decision this does
        not make. Their documented relation to :attr:`control_dt` is unchecked
        for the same reason.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If either body index is not a non-negative whole number,
                or is not a row of :attr:`body_names`; if

    An empty sidecar is the limit of "fields absent from the yaml", so it
    yields the all-defaults config exactly as ``{}`` does - the two spell the
    same information. ``~`` in ``path`` is expanded, the file is read as a
    file, and a payload that is not a mapping is reported by name rather than
    reaching the field lookups below: the reporting the sibling policy-config
    file loaders in :mod:`strands_robots.policies.kimodo.config` and
    :mod:`strands_robots.policies.wbc.config` already give.

    The extension is deliberately not checked, unlike the loader that does:
    a yaml document stored under any name loads here today, and refusing one
    would stop a payload that currently works.

    Args:
        path: Path to the yaml file. ``~`` is expanded.

    Returns:
        A :class:`ProtoMotionsConfig` - validated for consistent dimensions.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If ``path`` does not name a file (a directory does
            not, so it is refused here rather than at the read).
        ImportError: If ``pyyaml`` is not installed.
        ValueError: If the file is not valid YAML, or holds a YAML value that
            is not a mapping, or contains an inconsistent dimension: a
            ``stiffness`` or ``damping`` length that is not the joint count, or
            an ``anchor_body_index`` / ``root_body_index`` that is not a row
            of ``body_names``, or an ``action_ema_alpha`` outside ``(0, 1]``
            (each refused by :meth:`ProtoMotionsConfig.__post_init__`, so a
            config built by hand reports the same value the same way).
