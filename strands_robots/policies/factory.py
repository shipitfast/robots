    reports: aliases declared in ``policies.json`` and aliases passed to

    """Why ``kwargs`` cannot be handed to ``PolicyClass`` as written, or ``None``.

    One rule for every provider, applied before construction. Pre-fix each
    provider had its own: a constructor with ``**kwargs`` dropped
    ``create_policy("groot", hots="x")`` silently (the client dialled the
    default host under ``status="success"``), ``remote`` and ``lerobot_async``
    logged "ignoring unexpected constructor kwarg(s)" where no agent reads it,
    and a constructor without a sink raised CPython's
    ``__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'acton_space'`` - which
    names neither the provider nor the parameter meant.

    A name the constructor binds passes. A name that misspells one it binds
    (:data:`_MISSPELLING_RATIO`) is refused naming the parameter meant: no
    call can intend it, and a sink makes it byte-identical to omitting the
    argument. A name that is neither is refused when the constructor has no
    sink (it would have raised anyway - this names the provider and lists
    what it does accept) and tolerated when it has one, because a provider's
    ``**kwargs`` is its documented pass-through (model-loader options,
    another provider's keys on a shared ``policy_config``), logged at DEBUG so
    it is visible somewhere.

    Args:
        provider: The canonical provider name, quoted in the report.
        PolicyClass: The class about to be constructed.
        kwargs: The resolved constructor kwargs.

    This is the agent-tool companion to :func:`preflight_policy`, which
    deliberately swallows resolution failures on the stated grounds that

    escapes the ``status=error`` envelope those tools are documented to return,
    and ``start_policy`` builds the policy on a worker thread, so the raise is
    never surfaced at all and the caller is told the policy started. Returning
    the reason lets each surface report it on its own channel instead.

    guessed a name gets the available set back rather than a traceback.
