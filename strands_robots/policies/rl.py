"""Roll out an actor trained by the RL trainers (``create_policy("rl")``).

The inference half of the RL loop. ``create_trainer("ppo" | "fast_sac" |
"fast_td3")`` trains against a :class:`~strands_robots.training.rl.env.SimEnv`
and writes ``policy.pt`` + ``policy_meta.json``; this provider loads that pair
and presents it as an ordinary :class:`~strands_robots.policies.base.Policy`, so
a trained actor drives a robot through the same
:meth:`~strands_robots.simulation.base.SimEngine.run_policy` /
:meth:`~strands_robots.simulation.base.SimEngine.eval_policy` path as every
other provider::

    result = create_trainer("ppo").train(spec)
    sim.run_policy(robot_name="so101", policy_provider="rl",
                   policy_config={"checkpoint_dir": result.checkpoint_dir})

``checkpoint_dir`` is spelled as the trainer spells it (``TrainResult.checkpoint_dir``,
``BaseRLAlgo.load_checkpoint``, ``latest_checkpoint``), so the value a caller
already holds is the value this provider takes.

The checkpoint's ``actor_obs_keys`` are read from the observation by name, in the
trained order, because that order is part of the weights: an actor trained on
``["1", "2", "1.vel"]`` fed ``["1", "1.vel", "2"]`` is being given a different
input. A key the observation does not carry is refused rather than defaulted -
substituting a zero would command a real robot from a fabricated state.
