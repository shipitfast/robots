    Deliberately optimistic at one edge: a module that exists but exposes no
    :class:`~strands_robots.policies.Policy` subclass (``base``, ``factory``)
    is reported as resolving, and ``import_policy_class`` refuses it later.

    The policy registry's ``requires`` lists the keywords a caller MUST supply

    them and only fail once the rollout asks for its first action, on a worker
    thread, with the arm already energized and nobody left to tell.
    ``LerobotLocalPolicy`` defaults ``pretrained_name_or_path=""`` and loads
    lazily, so it builds and then raises "No model loaded and no
    pretrained_name_or_path set"; ``Gr00tPolicy`` builds with no ``port`` and

    # that default and discards a value the caller did supply -- the same
    # silent fallback to a default that #317 fixed for URL-parsed host/port.
