"""JSON registry loader with content-keyed hot-reload and validation.

Loads robots.json and policies.json from the registry directory,
re-reading only when the on-disk source changes.  Validates uniqueness of
aliases, shorthands, and URL patterns on every reload.

The ``robots`` registry is not a single file: its effective contents are the
package ``robots.json`` merged with the user-local overlay
(``$STRANDS_BASE_DIR/user_robots.json``, read through :mod:`._overlay` - see
:func:`_merge_user_robots`).  The
hot-reload signature therefore covers *both* files, so an edit to the user
overlay made outside this process (a second process, a manual edit, or any
writer that does not call :func:`invalidate_cache`) is picked up on the next
read - honoring the "re-read when the source changes" contract for the overlay
just as for the package file.

The signature is the file *contents*, not a stat.  A timestamp cannot express
"the source changed": the kernel stamps ``st_mtime`` from a coarse clock, so
two writes inside one tick share a timestamp and the second one is invisible -
permanently, because that timestamp never changes again.  The bytes are the
only field that always differs when the contents differ, so a cached value is
served only while the file still holds the bytes it was parsed from.  The read
is what licenses the hit; the parse and validation are the work it saves.
