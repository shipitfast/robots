"""Shared, defense-in-depth input validation for the training backends.

Every concrete :class:`~strands_robots.training.base.Trainer` translates a
:class:`~strands_robots.training.base.TrainSpec` into its backend's native
config object and runs it IN-PROCESS (imported and called as a library - no
subprocess). The ``train_policy`` ``@tool`` lets an agent (LLM) populate that
``TrainSpec`` directly, so the path fields and the free-form ``extra`` dict are
*untrusted input that reaches backend internals*. Per ``AGENTS.md`` > Review
Learnings (#92) > "LLM Input Safety", those values MUST be validated before they
can become a config field, a Hydra override, or a token in a backend's
argv-parity helper: a value beginning with ``-`` could read as a *new flag*, and
an arbitrary ``extra`` key could set an arbitrary config attribute / override.

:func:`validate_train_inputs` is the single source of that check. It is invoked
from every backend's :meth:`Trainer.validate`, which each backend's
:meth:`Trainer.train` calls (fail-closed) before building any config - so no
run can start with unvalidated input regardless of the call path.
