"""Trainer abstraction - post-tune any policy provider natively.

:class:`Trainer` is the training-side peer of
:class:`~strands_robots.policies.base.Policy`: where ``Policy`` hides how a
model produces actions, ``Trainer`` hides how a model is post-tuned. The
pipelines differ per provider:

* **LeRobot** - build a ``TrainPipelineConfig``, call
  ``lerobot.scripts.lerobot_train.train(cfg)``. HF-native checkpoints.
* **GR00T N1.7** - build a ``FinetuneConfig`` -> ``Config``, call
  ``gr00t.experiment.experiment.run(config)``.
* **Cosmos3** - build the SFT ``Config`` via ``load_experiment_from_toml``,
  call ``cosmos_framework.scripts.train.launch(config, args)``, with a DCP
  checkpoint conversion prepare step and a DCP -> safetensors export step.
* **SageMaker** - submit the same spec as one managed AWS training job.

The first three are *local*: they run in-process and multi-GPU goes through
torch's programmatic ``elastic_launch``. SageMaker is pure *transport*: it
imports no training library and its run outlives the submitting process, which
is what decides each shape's :meth:`Trainer.train` return contract.

All of them converge on one dataset format - LeRobotDataset v3, what
:class:`~strands_robots.dataset_recorder.DatasetRecorder` writes - and one
lifecycle: ``validate -> prepare -> train -> export``. A ``Trainer`` is
selected by the same provider name as its ``Policy``, so one registry identity
owns both classes. See :class:`~strands_robots.training.mock.MockTrainer` for
the no-dependency reference implementation.

@dataclass
class TrainSpec:
    """Provider-agnostic post-tuning specification.

    Concrete trainers read the fields they support and **ignore the rest** -
    the same tolerance rule :meth:`Policy.get_actions` applies to its
    ``**kwargs``. Backends MUST NOT raise on a field they do not use; new
    backend-specific knobs live in :attr:`extra` until >=2 backends share them.
    A backend that reads a field MUST preflight it through the matching
    ``Trainer._*_problems`` gate rather than judge it itself.

    Attributes:
        dataset_root: LeRobotDataset v3 root (contains ``meta/info.json``).
            Optional when :attr:`dataset_repo_id` is set, where it acts as the
            local cache root.
        dataset_repo_id: Hub dataset id (``org/name``) to train from the Hub
            instead of a local root. Supply exactly one data source.
        streaming: Stream frames instead of materializing the dataset. A
            ``bool``. LeRobot-only, and mutually exclusive there with
            :attr:`val_episodes`: a held-out split rebuilds both splits as
            map-style datasets and drops the stream.
        base_model: HF model id or local checkpoint path to post-tune from.
        output_dir: Directory for checkpoints, logs and the final artifact.
        embodiment: Embodiment tag / robot id - which state/action projector
            head the run trains. Required by GR00T. On LeRobot it is read by
            the policies whose config declares ``embodiment_tag`` (GR00T's
            native port); every other LeRobot policy takes its state/action
            shape from the dataset features and has no such field, so a
            backend MUST refuse the request rather than train the default head
            while reporting success.
        steps: Total optimizer steps. A positive ``int``.
        global_batch_size: Batch summed across GPUs before grad accumulation.
            A positive ``int``.
        learning_rate: Optimizer learning rate, or ``None`` for the backend's
            own default. When given, a positive finite number: ``0`` trains the
            full run without updating a weight and ``inf`` checkpoints ``NaN``.
        save_freq: Checkpoint cadence in steps, consumed as the modulus of a
            ``step % save_freq`` test. A non-negative whole number;
            non-positive disables periodic saving so only the final checkpoint
            is written.
        num_gpus: GPUs on this node. A positive ``int``; ``>1`` runs the
            backend under torch's in-process ``elastic_launch``.
        num_nodes: Nodes for multi-node training. Same domain as ``num_gpus``.
        resume: Resume from the latest checkpoint under ``output_dir``. A
            ``bool``.
        seed: Master seed (best-effort). A non-negative ``int`` or ``None``.
        method: Tuning strategy - ``"full"`` | ``"lora"`` | ``"expert_only"``
            | ``"frozen_backbone"``. ``lora`` and ``expert_only`` are mutually
            exclusive (both freeze the VLM).
        lora_r: LoRA adapter rank. A positive ``int``, or ``None`` for peft's
            default. Read only when ``method == "lora"``.
        lora_alpha: Numerator of the ``lora_alpha / lora_r`` scaling. Same
            domain as ``lora_r``.
        lora_target_modules: Target modules, or ``None`` for the policy's
            built-in defaults.
        tune: Component toggles for backends that expose them (GR00T:
            ``{"llm", "visual", "projector", "diffusion"} -> bool``, both
            through Isaac-GR00T's ``--tune_*`` flags and through LeRobot's
            native ``GrootConfig.tune_*`` fields). A key naming no component,
            or a component the policy cannot freeze, MUST be refused: an
            unforwarded toggle trains the config default, which is
            indistinguishable from never having asked.
        val_episodes: Hold out the last N episodes as a validation set, or
            ``None`` to train on every episode. A positive ``int`` below the
            dataset's episode count, which comes from a local
            ``meta/info.json`` - a backend that cannot read one MUST refuse
            rather than emit no split. The count becomes a real-valued split
            fraction whose ceiling lerobot takes. A backend MUST make the
            reserved episodes produce a validation signal, not merely shrink
            the training set.
        augmentation: Backend-specific data augmentation (GR00T
            ``color_jitter_params`` / ``random_rotation_angle``; Cosmos
            dataset filter dict).
        fps: Dataset control rate, when a backend needs it explicitly.
        extra: Raw passthrough; keys become backend-native flags or overrides
            (lerobot ``--key=value``, Cosmos Hydra ``key.path=value``). A value
            may be given as text or as the destination field's own Python type,
            and a backend that assigns into a typed config MUST decode text
            with the same decoder its ``--key=value`` form uses. LeRobot uses
            draccus: ``false``/``no``/``off`` and ``true``/``yes``/``on`` are
            booleans in any case, ``0`` and ``1`` are not, and text that does
            not decode to the field's type is refused.
