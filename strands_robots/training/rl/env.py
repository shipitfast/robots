"""Gym-style single-environment adapter over a ``SimEngine`` for RL training.

``SimEnv`` turns the simulation's observe / act / reward primitives into the
``reset -> step`` contract on-policy RL needs, reusing the existing reward-term
DSL (:data:`strands_robots.simulation.predicates.RewardTerm`) for the reward
signal. It produces batched tensors with a leading ``num_envs == 1`` axis so the
trainer code is shaped the same way it would be for a future vectorized backend
(IsaacGym / MJWarp), where only the env count changes.

The observation contract is the holosoma ``actor_obs_keys`` / ``critic_obs_keys``
split: the actor sees ``actor_obs_keys`` (deployable on hardware), the critic may
additionally see privileged simulation-only keys via ``critic_obs_keys``
(asymmetric actor-critic). Additionally is literal - the critic observation is
``actor_obs_keys`` followed by each ``critic_obs_keys`` entry not already among
them, so naming a privileged key never costs the critic the state the actor
sees. Each key is a scalar entry of ``SimEngine.get_observation`` (e.g. a joint
position ``"Elbow"`` or velocity ``"Elbow.vel"``); the vector is the keys
concatenated in the given order.

The action contract is the other half: ``step`` sends a numeric vector, which
``SimEngine.send_action`` binds positionally to
``robot_action_keys(robot_name)``. Those are the robot's *actuators*, which are
not always its joints - a tendon-driven gripper is one actuator over two finger
joints, and the Newton backend's floating base is a joint with no commandable
scalar - so the action head is sized from the action keys and a checkpoint
records them as ``action_keys``. Pass ``action_dim`` to override the width.

#: Accepted domain of every numeric :class:`SimEnv` stores, by parameter name.
#:
#: The constructor already refused an empty ``actor_obs_keys`` / ``reward_terms``
#: and a non-positive ``n_substeps`` -- and ``n_substeps``' own reason ("the PD
#: controller needs several substeps to track the target, so a single substep
#: barely moves the arm") is exactly what an unusable ``action_scale`` does, more
#: completely: it multiplies the target itself. Reading the domain from one table
#: keeps the two kinds of numeric on the two shared rules the rest of the library
#: uses for them, and lets a test assert that no numeric is left unchecked.
#:
#: Each domain is the one its *consumer* can honor, so no knob is refused here
#: for a value the code downstream accepts:
#:
#: * ``action_scale`` is a dimensionless multiplier - the family
#:   :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_finite_number_error` already owns
#:   (``0`` makes the scaled quantity degenerate, a negative value inverts it,
#:   ``nan`` poisons every comparison and ``inf`` is not a large scale).
#: * ``n_substeps`` is forwarded verbatim to ``SimEngine.send_action``, which
#:   guards it with :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_whole_number_error` -
#:   so that is the domain here too. The narrower alternative would refuse an
#:   ``np.int64`` or a ``3.0`` read from a config that ``send_action`` honors,
#:   making this guard stricter than the surface it feeds.
#: * ``max_episode_steps`` is only ever compared against the step counter, so an
#:   integral real is equally usable and it takes the same whole-number domain.
#: * ``action_dim`` sizes the trainers' action head (a ``torch.nn.Linear`` width),
#:   where an integral float raises rather than being coerced, so only a true
#:   ``int`` can be honored: :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error`.
#:
#: All three count domains refuse the same unusable values (``0``, a negative,
#: ``bool``, a fractional, ``nan``/``inf``, a string); they differ only in which
#: *usable* spellings of a count they admit.

    The asymmetric actor-critic split is additive: the critic sees everything the
    actor sees and *may* see more - privileged simulation-only quantities the
    deployed policy cannot read. So the composed list is ``actor_keys`` in order,
    then each privileged key not already among them. A critic that saw only the
    privileged keys would have lost the state it is estimating a value for, which
    is strictly worse than the symmetric default.

    A repeat is dropped rather than appended because the observation is the keys
    concatenated: naming an actor key again would widen the critic observation
    with a second copy of a scalar it already holds, and that width sizes the
    trainers' value/Q heads and is stamped into a checkpoint as
    ``num_critic_obs``.

    Args:
        actor_keys: The actor's observation keys, in the order it sees them.
        privileged: Extra keys for the critic, or ``None`` for a symmetric
            critic. An empty sequence means the same thing as ``None``: there is

class SimEnv:
    """Single-environment RL wrapper around a :class:`SimEngine`.

    Args:
        engine: A live ``SimEngine`` with at least one robot added.
        actor_obs_keys: Ordered observation keys the policy (actor) sees. Each
            must be a scalar key returned by ``engine.get_observation``.
        reward_terms: Reward-term callables (``RewardTerm`` = ``SimEngine ->
            float``); the step reward is their sum. Build them with the
            predicate DSL (e.g. ``_joint_progress``, ``_distance_neg``).
        action_dim: Size of the action vector sent to ``engine.send_action``.
            Defaults to ``len(engine.robot_action_keys(robot_name))`` - the
            actuator count ``send_action`` binds a vector against, which is not
            always the robot's joint count. When given it must be a positive
            integer.
        robot_name: Robot to observe / drive. Defaults to the engine's first
            registered robot.
        critic_obs_keys: Optional privileged simulation-only keys the critic
            sees in addition to the actor's (asymmetric actor-critic). The
            critic observation is ``actor_obs_keys`` followed by these, so a key
            the actor already sees adds nothing and ``None`` - or an empty
            sequence - leaves the critic symmetric. Each must be a scalar
            ``get_observation`` key, like the actor's.
        max_episode_steps: Steps before the episode is truncated (time-out).
            Must be a positive whole number; ``0`` reports a time-out on the
            first step, so every episode is over before it begins.
        action_scale: Scalar multiplier applied to actions before sending.
            Must be a positive finite number: it is the magnitude bound on how
            far one action step may move a joint, so ``0`` disconnects the
            policy from the robot and a non-finite value makes every command
            unsendable (see :data:`_NUMERIC_DOMAINS`).
        n_substeps: Physics control substeps per env step. The action is a
            position target; the PD controller needs several substeps to track
            it, so a single substep barely moves the arm. Default 5. Shares
            ``send_action``'s own domain for this parameter (see
            :data:`_NUMERIC_DOMAINS`).
        success_fn: Optional predicate; when it returns ``True`` the episode
            terminates (a genuine terminal, not a time-out).
        reset_fn: Optional callable run on ``engine`` at each reset (e.g. to
            randomize the target). Defaults to ``engine.reset()``.
        device: Torch device for the returned tensors.
        skip_images: Pass ``skip_images=True`` to ``get_observation`` (scalar
            state only) - the default, since the obs keys are scalar.
