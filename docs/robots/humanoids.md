# Humanoids

Full-body humanoids and expressive desktop robots.

```python
from strands_robots import Robot
sim = Robot("unitree_g1")       # Unitree G1
sim = Robot("unitree_h1")       # Unitree H1
sim = Robot("apollo")           # Apptronik Apollo
sim = Robot("reachy_mini")      # Pollen Reachy Mini (expressive)
```

## Catalog

Every robot in this family, generated from `robots.json` at build time. Renders are MuJoCo sim renders, never hardware photos.

## Real hardware: the Booster T1 native driver

The T1 is driven natively through its own SDK
(`booster_robotics_sdk_python`, a pybind11 wrapper over the robot's DDS
transport) — lerobot has no robot type for it, so `driver="strands"` is the only
way to reach it and the registry declares it as the default:

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

t1 = Robot("booster_t1", mode="real", port="192.168.10.102")  # driver="strands"
t1.connect_eagerly()          # ChannelFactory + loco client + LowState/LowCmd channels

t1.move(vx=0.2)               # walk: a twist to the onboard controller
t1.rotate_head(pitch=0.1, yaw=-0.3)

t1.enable_upper_body(True)    # claim the arms (UpperBodyCustomControl)
t1.send_action({"left_shoulder_pitch": -0.4, "right_elbow_pitch": 0.7})
t1.stop_task()                # halt locomotion + hand the arms back
```

Control of the T1 is **split**, and the driver enforces the split rather than
documenting it. An onboard whole-body controller owns the legs, waist and head;
the eight upper-body joints can be handed to a host, and only then:

| Slots | Joints | Who commands them |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 2–9 | `left`/`right` `shoulder_pitch`, `shoulder_roll`, `elbow_pitch`, `elbow_yaw` | the host, via `send_action`, after `enable_upper_body(True)` |
| 0–1 | `head_yaw`, `head_pitch` | the robot, via `rotate_head()` |
| 10–22 | waist, hips, knees, ankle cranks | the robot, via `move()` |

Every frame the driver publishes puts `kp=kd=0` on every slot outside 2–9, which
is what leaves the onboard controller in charge of balance; an uncommanded arm
joint holds its last *observed* position, so commanding one arm does not drop the
other. `send_action` refuses before the gate is open, before the first `LowState`
has arrived (the frame width and the hold positions both come from the robot's
own report), and for any joint outside the upper body — naming `move()` or
`rotate_head()` instead.

The driver also subscribes the T1's battery and fall-down topics. A fall state
other than `IS_READY` refuses a write — a held arm posture is noise while the
robot is on its way to, on, or getting off the floor, and can obstruct its
getting-up routine — and the gate reads *evidence of a fall* rather than the
absence of a reading, so a T1 whose fall topic is silent keeps writing. The
charge read reaches `get_status()` as the shared `battery_pct` field and gates
nothing: the SDK names it `soc` and documents no scale, and a floor compared
against an unverified scale refuses every frame or none while looking like a
working check.

`run_policy`/`start_task` refuse: this driver publishes one frame per call and
owns no control loop. A caller who wants a trajectory calls `send_action` on
their own timer (the vendor's reference client runs 100 Hz).

The SDK is a vendor wheel rather than a declared dependency of this project
(`pip install booster_robotics_sdk_python`, linux wheels only) — the same footing
as the G1's `unitree_sdk2py` ([recipe](#installing-the-unitree-sdk)). Without it the driver still imports, builds and
answers `get_status`; `connect_eagerly()` returns a reason naming the module and
the install line. Because the wheel is pinned to the robot's firmware
rather than resolved by this project, the *installed* build's vocabulary is an
input: `ROBOT_MODES` and the two `cmd_type` conventions are names this driver
spells so a caller sees them without the SDK, and a build that declares a
different set is refused by name — naming the enum, the member and the modes
that build does have — rather than raising out of the verb.

## Real hardware: the Unitree G1 native driver

The G1 has no lerobot robot type either, so `mode="real"` builds the native
CycloneDDS driver in `strands_robots.drivers.g1` (the registry declares
`hardware.driver = "strands"`):

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

g1 = Robot("g1", mode="real", port="192.168.123.161")   # network_interface="eth0" by default
g1.connect_eagerly()      # subscribes rt/lowstate, bms, lidar, mainboard; None when the bus is up
await g1.get_status()     # connection, FSM, battery
```

The driver-as-tool is deliberately small - `sensors`, `status`, `stop` - so an
agent can introspect the robot the day it is built. Motion goes through the
FSM-gated `g1_tools` bundle (`g1_send_action`, `g1_run_policy`, `g1_start_task`,
the `g1_safe_*` posture verbs) and, for the raw SDK, `use_unitree`; see the
[hardware tools](../hardware/tools.md) and [security](../security.md) pages.

### Installing the Unitree SDK

`unitree_sdk2py` is Unitree's vendor SDK and is **not** an extra of this
project. It cannot honestly be one: the PyPI `unitree-sdk2` 1.0.1 wheel ships no
`g1` or `comm` package (its `__init__` imports a `b2` it does not contain, so
`import unitree_sdk2py` fails) and pins `cyclonedds==0.10.2`, whose wheels stop
at Python 3.10 - under this project's `requires-python = ">=3.12"` that is a
source build that wants the CycloneDDS C library. Without the SDK the driver
still imports and builds; `connect_eagerly()` and every write verb return a
refusal that names this recipe.

A *partial* install fails elsewhere, and that is the shape the PyPI wheel
produces. With the bus bindings and the IDL types present but no `comm`
package, `connect_eagerly()` **succeeds** and the only thing that fails is the
motion-switcher open - reported as `motion_switcher_open_error` by the G1's
`get_status()`, and as the refusal from the Go2's `release_sport_mode()`. Both
name the same recipe and keep the SDK's own exception, so the module that is
actually missing is in the text.

The upstream checkout installed beside a `cyclonedds` wheel is what works. On
macOS arm64 and x86_64 Linux (Python 3.12):

```bash
pip install 'cyclonedds>=0.10.2,<12'
git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python
pip install --no-deps -e ./unitree_sdk2_python     # --no-deps skips the ==0.10.2 pin
python -c "from unitree_sdk2py.core.channel import ChannelFactoryInitialize; print('ok')"
```

On Linux aarch64 - the Jetson the robot ships with - `cyclonedds` publishes no
wheel at any version, so the C library comes first and the binding is built
against it:

```bash
git clone --branch 0.10.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds /tmp/cdds
cmake -S /tmp/cdds -B /tmp/cdds/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && sudo cmake --build /tmp/cdds/build --target install
export CYCLONEDDS_HOME=/usr/local
pip install 'cyclonedds==0.10.2'
git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python
pip install --no-deps -e ./unitree_sdk2_python
```

0.10.2 is the CycloneDDS release Unitree's own images and SDK pin, and the one
the `g1_tools` bundle was developed against. The 11.x wheel imports, builds the
IDL types and binds a `ChannelFactory`, but it has not been proven against a
live G1 bus; if the robot's topics stay silent under 11.x, build 0.10.2 as
above. Point `CYCLONEDDS_URI` at the robot's `cyclonedds.xml` when the default
multicast discovery does not find it.

## Real hardware: the Microduck robotd driver

The Microduck is driven natively through its on-robot
`robotd` daemon (Pollen's `duck-ipc-proto` JSON-RPC over a Unix socket) — the
same policy code that runs in sim drives the physical robot:

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

# On the robot (robotd's default socket), or a socket forwarded over SSH.
duck = Robot("microduck", mode="real")                       # /run/robotd.sock
duck = Robot("microduck", mode="real", port="/tmp/robotd.sock")

duck.connect_eagerly()                 # Hello handshake + subscribe to state
duck.send_action({"vx": 0.15})         # walk forward (robot.move intent)
duck.send_action({"skill": "kick_left"})  # a named skill (robot.do)
duck.emergency_stop()                  # robot.stop
```

Every intent frame carries its whole group -- `robot.move` always carries
`vx`/`vy`/`vyaw`, `robot.pose` always `z`/`roll`/`pitch`/`active` -- so an
absent key is the resting value (`{"vx": 0.15}` walks straight ahead) and a key
this driver does not know is refused, even with a known key beside it. That
distinction matters because the two are indistinguishable on the wire:
`{"vx": 0.15, "yaw": 0.6}` -- `yaw` being the spelling the `get_status` pose
block uses for the heading -- would otherwise send `vyaw: 0`, walk straight past
the turn and report success. The same refusal catches a 14-joint
`MICRODUCK_JOINT_NAMES` action: four of its keys are head axes, so it would
arrive as a `robot.head` frame with the other ten joints dropped, which is the
per-joint stream `run_policy` refuses by name.

All three halt paths - `stop()`, `stop_task()` and `emergency_stop()` - send the
same `robot.stop`, and an accepted one is recorded in
`get_status()["motion_stopped"]`, the field an operator reads to decide whether
the robot is safe to approach. Only an accepted halt sets it: a stop robotd
declines leaves it false. `relax()` and `enable_torque(False)` de-energise rather
than halt a commanded motion, so they leave the flag alone.

`robotd` owns the walking/skill ONNX on-device, so `run_policy`/`start_task`
refuse and point back at the intent path; use `mode="sim"` for a host-driven
[`MicroduckPolicy` rollout](../policies/microduck.md#walking-in-mujoco). For a remote robot, forward its socket to a local
path (`ssh -L`/`socat`) and pass that path as `port=`.

## Mounting a camera on a humanoid

`add_camera(parent_body=...)` mounts a camera ON a body so it rides with the
robot, and `position`/`target` are then in that body's LOCAL frame. The general
recipe in [World building](../simulation/world-building.md) reads the mount from
`list_bodies(robot_name=...)["gripper_body"]`, which is the right mount for an
arm. A humanoid here reports `gripper_body: None`: that hint set (`gripper`,
`hand`, `jaw`, `ee`, `tool`) is arm-shaped, and matching it on word boundaries is
what keeps a leg out of the answer - a `knee` link is not an end-effector because
`ee` occurs in its name. Pick the mount from the full `bodies` list instead.

For a head camera there is no head link to pick. The Unitree G1 asset's body tree
ends at the wrists - `pelvis` to hips/knees/ankles, and `waist_yaw_link` to
`waist_roll_link` to `torso_link` to shoulders/elbows/wrists - with no
`head_link`, `neck_link` or `eye_link`; its only sites are two IMUs and the two
feet. Mount on the torso with a local offset instead:

```python
sim = Robot("unitree_g1")
sim.add_camera(name="head", parent_body="unitree_g1/torso_link",
               position=[0.08, 0.0, 0.35], target=[1.0, 0.0, 0.2])
```

That puts the camera 0.35 m above the torso frame, roughly head height, and it
rides with the torso through waist yaw and roll. An arm camera mounts the same
way on a wrist link (`unitree_g1/left_wrist_yaw_link`). Bodies are namespaced by
the name passed to `Robot(...)`, so `Robot("g1")` would report `g1/torso_link`.
