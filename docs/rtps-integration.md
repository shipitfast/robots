# Pure-RTPS ROS 2 integration

ROS 2 runs over DDS, and DDS speaks RTPS on the wire. `use_rtps` lets a strands
agent join a ROS 2 graph as a **first-class DDS participant** using only the
pip-installable `cyclonedds` binding - **no `rclpy`, no sourced ROS 2 distro, no
`ros2` CLI**. Because RTPS is stable across ROS 2 distros, one implementation
interoperates with Humble, Jazzy, Rolling, and beyond.

## use_ros vs use_rtps

| | `use_ros` | `use_rtps` |
|---|-----------|------------|
| Role | client / observer | **participant / robot** |
| Backend | in-process `rclpy` | `cyclonedds` (pip wheel; source build on Linux aarch64) |
| Needs sourced ROS 2 | yes | **no** |
| Type coverage | any installed interface | curated IDL bundle |
| Runs on macOS / CI bare | no (needs ROS) | **yes** |

Use `use_ros` when you have ROS 2 sourced and need full type coverage or
services. Use `use_rtps` when you want zero-install interop or to **act as a
robot** - publishing topics a real ROS 2 stack (rviz, nav2, a teleop node) will
consume, indistinguishable from hardware on the wire.

```bash
pip install 'strands-robots[ros2]'   # cyclonedds - a self-contained wheel on macOS / Windows / Linux x86_64
```

### Linux aarch64 (Jetson)

No cyclonedds release publishes a Linux aarch64 wheel (checked against every
release on PyPI), so on a Jetson, a Thor dev kit or a humanoid's onboard PC the
same command resolves to the **sdist**, and its build needs an existing Cyclone
DDS C install pointed at by `CYCLONEDDS_HOME` (plus `python3-dev`). Two ways to
have one:

```bash
# (a) a sourced ROS 2 distro already ships it
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-cyclonedds
CYCLONEDDS_HOME=/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO pip install 'strands-robots[ros2]'

# (b) no ROS 2 on the box: build Cyclone DDS from source (ENABLE_TYPELIB stays ON)
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds
cmake -S cyclonedds -B cyclonedds/build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/cyclonedds
cmake --build cyclonedds/build --target install
export CYCLONEDDS_HOME=$HOME/cyclonedds     # keep it set at runtime too - add to ~/.bashrc
pip install 'strands-robots[ros2]'
```

At runtime the binding locates `libddsc` itself, trying a wheel's bundled copy,
then `$CYCLONEDDS_HOME/lib`, then the normal loader path. So keep
`CYCLONEDDS_HOME` exported whenever the install prefix is somewhere the loader
does not already search - route (b)'s `$HOME/cyclonedds`, or
`/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO` in a shell that has not sourced the distro. Install to the
default `/usr/local` prefix instead and `ldconfig` finds `libddsc.so.0`, so the
import needs no variable at all. If `CYCLONEDDS_HOME` *is* set it must be
correct: the loader raises `CycloneDDSLoaderException: Failed to load CycloneDDS
library from <CYCLONEDDS_HOME>/lib/libddsc.so` instead of falling back to the
system path, so a stale export breaks an install that would otherwise work.

## Actions

| Action | Required args | Returns |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `status` | - | Whether the cyclonedds backend is available |
| `types` | - | The ROS 2 message types in the local IDL bundle |
| `advertise` | `topic`, `type` | Creates a publisher (appear on the graph) |
| `publish` | `topic`, `type` | Publishes N messages built from `fields` |
| `subscribe` | `topic`, `type` | Creates a subscription |
| `echo` | `topic`, `type` | Returns the next N samples as JSON |

Scope (v1) is topics only; services and actions need the ROS 2 request/reply-
over-DDS protocol and are a focused follow-up.

## Type coverage

To publish a message you must own its type definition locally, so `use_rtps`
ships a curated IDL bundle (`strands_robots.rtps.idl`) of the common ROS 2
messages, registered under their ROS 2 type strings: the `geometry_msgs`
primitives (`Twist`/`Pose`/...) plus the `sensor_msgs` `JointState` and `Image`
(with their `std_msgs/Header` + `builtin_interfaces/Time` chain) that the
rclpy-free hardware bridge publishes. List them with
`use_rtps(action="types")`. Arbitrary custom messages are out of scope until
cyclonedds-python's dynamic (XTypes) support matures - use `use_ros` (rclpy) for
those.

ROS 2 names are mangled to their DDS form automatically: a topic `/turtle1/cmd_vel`
becomes `rt/turtle1/cmd_vel`, and a type `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` becomes
`geometry_msgs::msg::dds_::Twist_` - the conventions that make a bare DDS
participant interoperable with real ROS 2 nodes.

### What counts as a topic name

A name only this package accepts still maps to a DDS topic, and nothing reports
the divergence: DDS matches by topic name, so the participant advertises a name
`rclpy` refuses at `create_publisher` and simply never finds a peer. So the rule
is the ROS 2 mapping's own, in full, and it is enforced once - in
`strands_robots.rtps.mangling` as `ROS_TOPIC_RE` plus `MAX_DDS_TOPIC_LENGTH` -
with every seam that gates a caller name reading it rather than restating it.

| Refused | Because |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd_vel` | not absolute; a DDS write has no namespace to resolve against |
| `/a/` | a name must not end with `/` |
| `//bar`, `/a//b` | a name token must not be empty |
| `/1cam`, `/a/2b` | a token must not start with a digit |
| `/a__b` | a name must not contain repeated underscores |
| `/café`, `/bad name` | only ASCII `[A-Za-z0-9_]` and `/` |
| a name whose `rt`-prefixed form exceeds 256 characters | the mapping bounds the **DDS** name, prefix included |

A digit *inside* a token (`/turtle1/cmd_vel`) is legal, and so is a single
leading underscore (`/_hidden/x`, which ROS 2 treats as a hidden topic) - the
rule narrows to the mapping's set, not to something tighter. A refusal names the
one clause the name broke rather than reporting a generic "invalid topic name".

The `joint_states` / `image_raw` topics the hardware bridges publish on are held
to the same rule: `RosTelemetryBase` sanitises a robot or camera name into a
token that `ROS_TOPIC_RE` accepts, so a camera keyed by its device index
(`0`) publishes on `/<robot>/camera_0/image_raw` rather than on a
`/<robot>/0/image_raw` no ROS 2 node can subscribe to.

Message interfaces only. ROS 2 has no single DDS type for a service or an
action: `rosidl` generates one type per constituent message, so
`example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts` becomes
`example_interfaces::srv::dds_::AddTwoInts_Request_` and
`..._Response_` on the `rq`/`rr` prefixes rather than `rt`. A `pkg/srv/Name` or
`pkg/action/Name` type is therefore refused, with the types ROS 2 does generate
quoted - an invented `pkg::srv::dds_::AddTwoInts_` would match no participant,
and DDS reports a type mismatch as silence rather than as an error.

## Examples

```python
from strands_robots import use_rtps

use_rtps(action="status")
use_rtps(action="types")

# Act as a robot: advertise then drive a cmd_vel topic a real node consumes.
use_rtps(action="advertise", topic="/turtle1/cmd_vel", type="geometry_msgs/msg/Twist")
use_rtps(action="publish", topic="/turtle1/cmd_vel",
         type="geometry_msgs/msg/Twist",
         fields={"linear": {"x": 2.0}, "angular": {"z": 1.5}},
         count=15, rate=10.0)
```

## RtpsRobot: a ROS 2 robot over pure RTPS

`RtpsRobot` is the pure-RTPS sibling of `RosBridgedRobot`. It publishes through
the same participant `use_rtps` does (`strands_robots.rtps.participant`), so it
drives a ROS 2 mobile base with nothing but a pip wheel - and because it
publishes real DDS samples, it can act as the robot itself. A `cmd_vel` command
reaches the shared operator gate whichever of the two asked, under one label, so
an approval or a refusal means the same thing on both.

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_robots.mesh import RtpsRobot

turtle = RtpsRobot.from_rtps(
    node_name="turtlesim",
    cmd_vel_topic="/turtle1/cmd_vel",
)

turtle.advertise()                       # appear on the graph
turtle.drive(linear=1.0, duration=1.5)   # publish Twist over RTPS for 1.5 s
turtle.stop()

agent = Agent(tools=turtle.tools)        # drive_turtlesim, stop_turtlesim
agent("drive forward for two seconds")
```

See `examples/ros2/rtps_turtle_demo.py` for an end-to-end script, and
`tests_integ/tools/test_use_rtps_live.py` for the gated live test that drives a
real `turtlesim` from a bare participant (`RTPS_LIVE=1 pytest -m rtps`).

For a fully reproducible, self-contained cross-process proof (real turtlesim
node + our publisher, one command), see `examples/ros2/rtps_proof/`:

```bash
cd examples/ros2/rtps_proof
docker compose run --build --rm proof   # exits 0 iff the turtle moved
```

## Hardware bridge over pure RTPS (no rclpy)

`Robot(ros2_bridge=True)` defaults to the rclpy backend (`ros2_transport="rclpy"`,
full `sensor_msgs` fidelity, needs a sourced ROS 2 distro). Pass
`ros2_transport="rtps"` to run the **same bridge over pure cyclonedds** instead -
a single pip wheel, no rclpy and no sourced distro:

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

# rclpy-free: publishes /so101/joint_states (+ camera image_raw) over cyclonedds
# RTPS. Telemetry-only: the inbound /so101/joint_command -> send_action surface
# (ros2_commands=True, the default) drives the arm, so on this transport it needs
# the dds_security_config or explicit opt-out described below to start.
arm = Robot("so101", mode="real", ros2_bridge=True, ros2_transport="rtps", ros2_commands=False)
```

The two transports emit byte-identical topics, so a real ROS 2 node (or
`ros2 topic echo` / `ros2 topic pub`) cannot tell them apart on the wire:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /so101/joint_states     # decodes the cyclonedds-published JointState
ros2 topic pub --once /so101/joint_command sensor_msgs/msg/JointState \
  '{name: ["shoulder_pan.pos"], position: [0.1]}'   # drives the arm once commands are on (below)
```

The trade-off is the same as `use_rtps`: type coverage is bounded by the IDL
bundle (joint_states + image_raw are in; anything else needs the rclpy backend).
The bridge is implemented by `strands_robots.hardware_rtps_bridge.HardwareRtpsBridge`,
the rclpy-free sibling of `HardwareRosBridge`. Both derive from
`strands_robots.ros_telemetry.RosTelemetryBase`, which owns the topic names and the
inbound `joint_command` parsing, so the two transports are byte-identical on the wire
by construction; they present the identical `publish_joint_states` / `publish_image` /
inbound-`joint_command` surface.

## Securing the inbound command surface

The inbound `/<robot>/joint_command` subscription lets **any participant on the
DDS domain drive the physical arm**. Two layers harden it, both threaded through
the `Robot()` constructor.

### DDS Security gate (RTPS only)

When the command surface is enabled (`ros2_bridge=True`, `ros2_commands=True`,
`ros2_transport="rtps"`), `HardwareRtpsBridge` **refuses to start** unless one of
the following is true:

- a `dds_security_config` dict is supplied, or
- the operator sets `STRANDS_ROS2_BRIDGE_I_KNOW_THIS_IS_INSECURE=1` (truthy:
  `1` / `true` / `yes`) to explicitly accept an unsecured graph.

A telemetry-only bridge (`ros2_commands=False`) is publish-only and is **not**
gated. Because this gate branches on the same flag, `enable_commands` /
`ros2_commands` is checked rather than read by truthiness: a non-boolean is
refused before any DDS state exists, so a `"false"` from a deployment config
cannot be reported back as "an enabled command bridge" and answered with the
insecure opt-out that would open it. `dds_security_config` requires the following keys (each a **non-empty string**:
a path or a `file:` / `data:` URI per the OMG DDS-Security spec); `permissions_ca`
is optional, and held to the same domain when supplied:

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

arm = Robot(
    "so101",
    mode="real",
    ros2_bridge=True,
    ros2_transport="rtps",
    dds_security_config={
        "identity_ca":  "file:/etc/dds/identity_ca.pem",   # identity CA
        "certificate":  "file:/etc/dds/participant.pem",   # participant cert
        "private_key":  "file:/etc/dds/participant_key.pem",
        "governance":   "file:/etc/dds/governance.p7s",    # signed governance
        "permissions":  "file:/etc/dds/permissions.p7s",   # signed permissions
        # "permissions_ca": "file:/etc/dds/permissions_ca.pem",  # optional
    },
)
```

The credentials are wired into the cyclonedds `DomainParticipant` QoS together
with the builtin DDS-Security plugins, so **both** the outbound telemetry and the
inbound command surface ride an authenticated, access-controlled graph. A
half-filled config is rejected at construction, and so is a well-shaped one whose
credential is not a string: the participant carries a property per credential, so
a `None` would be dropped (auth plugin loaded, no private key) and a `bytes` path
spelled as its `repr`. The refusal names the key and what arrived
(`{'private_key': 'NoneType'}`), and no participant is created.

`dds_security_config` is RTPS-specific: passing it with `ros2_transport="rclpy"`
raises, because the rclpy backend gets its DDS Security from the ROS 2 RMW
keystore/env (`ROS_SECURITY_*` / `sros2`), not from a config dict.

### Joint position bounds

`joint_limits={"<motor>.pos": (min, max)}` (threaded into either transport)
range-checks every inbound command. If **any** commanded joint falls outside its
declared range, the **entire** command is rejected - never partially applied - so
one out-of-range joint can never drive part of the arm while the rest holds. Keys
are matched against the joint names the command carries, which are the
`<motor>.pos` names the bridge publishes in `joint_states`, so a controller can
echo them straight back and a key that names no commanded joint constrains
nothing. Joints without a declared bound are unconstrained; to leave a joint unbounded, omit it
rather than declaring an infinite bound. Every bound must be a finite number - a
non-finite one declares a range that admits nothing, and the bridge refuses it at
construction rather than dropping every command for that joint mid-run.

```python
arm = Robot(
    "so101",
    mode="real",
    ros2_bridge=True,
    ros2_transport="rtps",
    dds_security_config={...},
    joint_limits={"shoulder_pan.pos": (-3.14, 3.14), "elbow.pos": (-1.57, 1.57)},
)
```

## Safety

Agent-supplied topic and type names are validated before mangling, against the
same rule the mangling applies (see [What counts as a topic
name](#what-counts-as-a-topic-name)); types must be `pkg/msg/Name`. The tool
never constructs a shell command or generates source, so there is no
command-injection or `eval` surface. Backend, type-resolution, and field errors
are returned as structured `{"status": "error"}` results rather than raised.

The numeric options are checked in the same place, ahead of the backend probe, so
a refusal happens before a writer joins the graph and reports identically whether
or not `cyclonedds` is installed. `count` (`publish`, `echo`) must be a positive
integer, and `rate` (`publish`) and `timeout` (`echo`) must be positive finite
numbers - the same accepted domain `use_ros` enforces, so a value publishable
through one transport is publishable through the other. An option the requested
action never reads is not second-guessed.
