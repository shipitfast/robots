Parse results via `result["content"][0]["text"]`, not custom keys like `result["ports"]`.

Every parameter, default and refusal of every tool in the package - these and the G1 and
Reachy Mini verbs - is on the generated [tool reference](../reference/tools.md).

### `pose_tool` and `serial_tool` need pyserial

Both drive the servo bus through pyserial, and no extra of this project declares
it on its own - it arrives only inside `lerobot[feetech]`. Without it neither
tool imports, and the refusal names the remedy rather than leaving the
interpreter's `No module named 'serial'` as the only hint:

```bash
pip install pyserial
```

### Numeric options are checked before the session starts

A teleop session runs in a detached subprocess, so a value the lerobot CLI
cannot parse would not be reported by the call that supplied it - the session
would start, report a pid, and fail minutes later in its log. `lerobot_teleoperate`
therefore refuses an unusable numeric option up front, and only for the options
the requested action actually puts on the lerobot command line:

| Option | Accepted | Why the floor is where it is |
|--------|----------|------------------------------|
| `dataset_fps`, `fps` | positive whole number | lerobot declares both `int`; an integral float (`30.0`) is accepted and emitted as `30` |
| `dataset_num_episodes`, `dagger_num_episodes` | positive whole number | a recording of no episodes cannot be produced |
| `dataset_episode_time_s` | positive whole number | an episode of no length records nothing |
| `dataset_reset_time_s` | non-negative whole number | `0` is a real setting: no operator pause between episodes |
| `replay_episode` | non-negative whole number | `0` is the first episode |
| `teleop_time_s` | positive number, or `None` | lerobot declares it `float \| None`; `None` (the default) means no time limit, and a fractional budget is usable |

`teleop_time_s=0` is refused rather than read as "no limit" - it is the one value
that means "stop at once", so treating it as unset would invert the request.
Passing a value an action ignores is never an error: `action="start"` without a
`dataset_repo_id` teleoperates and reads no `dataset_*` option.

### A session is only forgotten once its process is gone

Both verbs answer through `psutil`, which `[lerobot]` supplies alongside
`lerobot` itself. `lerobot_train` and `lerobot_teleoperate` import it at module
scope, so it is a requirement of importing either tool rather than of some branch
inside it - an install that omits it ships both tools and can load neither.

Because the session runs detached, the on-disk session store is the only place
its pid is recorded - `stop` and `status` both look the session up there. Every
read loads, modifies and writes back, so a record a load leaves out is erased
from disk by the next session started or stopped. A read therefore deletes
nothing: `remove_session` is the only thing that drops a record, and being listed
is not a claim of running - `list` and `status` each derive that from the pid at
the moment they are asked, so a retained record reads as running only while its
pid still holds the process the record was written for. A finished run keeps its
record so `status` can still report the final log tail.

Both tools read and write one file, which is why they share one reader:
`SessionManager`, in `strands_robots.tools._process_stop`. Two readers of one
document could not hold two retention policies - whichever one deleted a record
would delete it for the other - so the file has one class over it and one
`SESSION_DIR` naming it.

Loading and writing back is also why the *write* has to land whole. A store that
lands partially does not lose the session being changed - it loses every session
the file held, in both tools at once, and the load path reports an unparseable
store as *no sessions*. So the map is
serialized in full before the destination is opened and committed through a temp
file plus an atomic rename: a full disk during a training run leaves the previous
store intact rather than truncated, and a record holding a value JSON cannot
represent is refused naming the store, with everything already recorded still
listed and still stoppable.

A pid alone cannot answer that, because the kernel hands the number back out once
the process holding it exits. Each record therefore also carries the identity of
the process it was written for - how long after boot that process started - and
"is it running" means *that* process, not whatever now holds its number. A start
offset rather than a creation date, because the record is written by one run and
read back by a later one: `/proc/stat`'s boot time is recomputed from the wall
clock on every read, so a date would move under an NTP correction while the
kernel's own start ticks do not.

Before either question can be asked, the number has to *be* a process id, and it
arrives from a file rather than from a caller. So it is graded, not converted:
`int()` of a value the store should not hold answers about a different process -
`int(4321.5)` is `4321`, and `true` is pid 1 - or raises on a value `json.load`
produces from a well-formed file (`1e400`, `NaN`, or the U+FFFD the store's own
decode policy substitutes for a damaged byte). A `pid` field holding anything but
a positive integer within the platform's `pid_t` range therefore means "this
record names no process": `list` and `status` report it as stopped, the teleop
store prunes it like any other record with no live process, the training store
keeps it and `stop` refuses it naming the type it found, and nothing is
signalled either way.

`lerobot_teleoperate` prunes a finished session:

| What the probe reports | Verdict |
|------------------------|---------|
| the pid no longer exists | finished - pruned |
| `psutil.NoSuchProcess` (reaped between the existence check and the probe) | finished - pruned |
| the process holding the pid started at some other time | the pid was reused - pruned |
| `psutil.AccessDenied` (the pid exists, this user may not inspect it) | kept on existence alone, and reported at `WARNING` |

The last row is why a session started under `sudo` - a common way to reach a
serial port - is still listed and still stoppable when the tool is later invoked
as the unprivileged user. Being kept is not a claim that it is running: `list`
and `status` each re-derive that at the moment you ask.

`lerobot_train` keeps a store of the same shape, held to the same rule, with one
deliberate difference: a finished run is *retained* so `status` can still show
the final log tail. Its load therefore drops nothing at all, and `stop` -
through `remove_session` - is what ends a record:

| What the probe reports | Verdict |
|------------------------|---------|
| the pid no longer exists, or another process now holds it | finished - kept for its log tail |
| `psutil.NoSuchProcess` (reaped between the existence check and the probe) | the same finished run - kept |
| `psutil.AccessDenied` (the pid exists, this user may not inspect it) | kept, and reported at `WARNING` |

The first two rows are one state reached two ways, and which way a given run
takes is a race between the two probes, so they are not classified differently.
The last row is the one where dropping the record would lose a pid that still
names a *live* process - a training run holding a GPU, with nothing left
recording where it is.

`stop` is held to the same standard from the other side. It checks that the pid is
still its session's process before it signals anything, and captures the process
identity *before* it signals - so the SIGKILL escalation is aimed at the process
it found, not at whatever holds the pid once the grace period is over - and then
reports only what it can establish:

| After SIGTERM, then SIGKILL | `stopped` | Result |
|-----------------------------|-----------|--------|
| the process left the process table | `true` | success, record dropped |
| it was already gone when `stop` looked | `true` | success ("already stopped"), record dropped |
| the pid is held by another process now | `true` | success, nothing signalled, record dropped |
| it is still there | `false` | error, record kept |
| whether it exited could not be determined (`AccessDenied`) | `null` | error, record kept |

Sending SIGKILL is not the same as the process exiting: the kernel delivers it
asynchronously, and a task inside an uninterruptible wait - a serial ioctl on the
teleop bus, a stalled CUDA call in a training step - stays in the table until that
wait returns. So the record is kept in exactly the cases where the exit was not
observed, because dropping it would leave the process running with nothing left
recording its pid.

### A raw servo write is bounded by the register it encodes into

`serial_tool` writes Feetech registers by masking the value into fixed-width
bytes of the outgoing packet, so an out-of-range value was never rejected on the
wire - it was truncated into a different, reachable command while the success
message quoted the value the caller supplied. `position=70000` put 4464 on the
wire and `position=-1` put 65535, the largest the two-byte field holds. Each
field is therefore bounded before the port is opened.

Two of those registers are bounded by more than their byte width. `Goal_Position`
and `Goal_Velocity` are sign-magnitude on the STS/SMS series - bit 15 carries the
direction - so a magnitude reaching that bit is not truncated but *reinterpreted*:
`velocity=65535` put those exact two bytes on the wire and the servo ran full
speed in the opposite direction, and `velocity=32768` read as magnitude zero,
stopping a servo the caller had just asked to run. `position` was already inside
that limit at 4095; `velocity` now is too.

`motor_id` takes more than the byte width for a different reason: the ID byte
carries one address that is no servo. `0xfe` is the broadcast, which every servo
on the bus receives, and for an instruction that expects a reply every servo
answers at once - on a half-duplex bus those replies collide, so what
`action="feetech_ping"` reads back belongs to no single servo. A reply-less
write to the broadcast means what it says and is still accepted, so
`feetech_position` and `feetech_velocity` take the whole `[1, 254]`; only a
reply-expecting action is held to a single servo. The Protocol 1 codec applies
the same rule to the frames it builds
(`build_packet(..., allow_broadcast=False)`), so the tool and the driver cannot
disagree about which address is a servo and which is the whole bus.

A *unicast* write is not reply-less. The addressed servo answers it with a
six-byte status packet - the frame a read is answered with, minus the parameters
- and that reply is the only evidence the motor took the command. The native
driver's bus reads it: `FeetechBus.set_torque` names a servo that did not
acknowledge, which is what lets the `stop` verb report a joint that may still be
driven instead of an arm that is safe to approach, and reading it is also what
keeps six unread acks from sitting in front of the next state read's reply
stream.

That sweep writes two registers per motor, `Torque_Enable` and then `Lock`, both
carrying the same value - the pairing LeRobot's `enable_torque` /
`disable_torque` use. `Lock` clear is what lets the servo's EEPROM (its ID, baud
rate and position limits, all of which persist across power) be written, and
`lerobot-calibrate` leaves the arm there, so energizing without it would drive
the arm with that region open. A `Lock` write that went unacknowledged is logged
rather than named in the return: the joint is in the state that was asked for,
and only its write protection is unknown.

| Option | Accepted | Why the bound is where it is |
|--------|----------|------------------------------|
| `motor_id` | integer in `[1, 254]`, or `[1, 253]` for an action that reads a reply | the frame carries the ID in one byte, of which `0xfd` is the highest a servo may hold and `0xfe` is the broadcast, while `0xff` is the header value |
| `position` | integer in `[0, 4095]` | `Goal_Position` is 12-bit on the STS/SMS series - the same full scale the reported angle divides by |
| `velocity` | integer in `[0, 32767]` | `Goal_Velocity` is sign-magnitude with bit 15 the direction bit, so a larger magnitude commands the opposite direction |
| `baudrate` | positive integer | pyserial coerces rather than checks, so `2.7` opens the port at 2 baud and `0` opens it at a speed no servo answers - the same domain every native serial driver holds its `baud_rate` to |
| `read_bytes` | positive integer | pyserial's read loop is `while len(read) < size`, so a non-positive size returns no bytes and looks like a timeout |
| `timeout` | finite number >= 0 | `0` is pyserial's non-blocking mode (return what is buffered); `nan` waits no time at all and `inf` overflows the deadline |

The same scoping rule applies: `action="read"` never looks at a servo register,
so a bad `motor_id` does not refuse it, and `action="list_ports"` reads none of
these options. An unset `motor_id` / `position` is still reported by the action's
own "required" message rather than as an unusable value.

`pose_tool` writes the same `Goal_Position` register through the same mask and
needs no bound of its own: it converts a target through `FeetechBus.to_counts`,
which refuses one the encoder cannot hold, so the mask only ever sees a value
that fits.

Both bounds and the reported angle are STS/SMS-series properties, not properties
of the register or of Feetech generally, and so is the two-byte order the value
is encoded into. Feetech publishes one framing document for the whole family and
ships one SDK for it, but that SDK's `PacketHandler` takes a per-model protocol
number and reverses the word order on it: protocol 0 (STS3215, STS3250, SM8512BL)
puts the low byte first, protocol 1 (the SCS series) puts the high byte first.
A position framed for one series is therefore a *different position* on the
other, not a mis-scaled one - `position=1023`, which is full scale on an
`scs0009`, is read by it as 65283. `strands_robots.drivers.feetech.protocol`
decides that order once (`encode_word` / `decode_word`) and holds the full scale
once (`MAX_GOAL_POSITION`), and every Feetech write path in the package - this
tool, `pose_tool`, and the native `FeetechDriver` bus - reads both from there.
Addressing an SCS-series servo needs a second word order and a second full scale
rather than a scale option, so no surface here offers one.

The read back is the same one authority. `Present_Position` is sign-magnitude on
this series - bit 15 is the direction - so `pose_tool` decodes a reply through
that module's `SIGN_BIT` table rather than deciding the bit itself. Read as an
unsigned field, a servo reporting a joint just past its homing zero answers with
an angle more than a full turn from where the joint is, and nothing on a read
path bounds the number it quotes.

### A stored pose is stored whole, or the tool reports that it was not

`store_pose` and `delete_pose` rewrite the *whole* pose library for a robot -
`<robot_id>_poses.json` under `.strands_robots/poses/` in the working directory -
so a write that lands partially loses every posture the arm had, not just the one
being changed. The document is therefore serialized before the destination is
touched and committed through a temp sibling plus `os.replace`. A full disk, or a
joint angle JSON cannot represent (a NumPy scalar), leaves the stored library
exactly as it was, with no temp file beside it, and the tool answers
`status="error"` naming the pose it did not store and the postures that are
unchanged - rather than reporting a named posture that no later `load_pose` can
find.

### `smooth` is checked, so a word for "no" cannot change the trajectory

`pose_tool`'s `smooth` selects one of two ways to reach the same joint targets,
not a magnitude: interpolate over `steps * step_delay` seconds, or write each
`Goal_Position` once and let the servo travel at its own speed. It was read by
truthiness, and the two undeclared halves invert in opposite directions:

| `smooth=` | Trajectory written | Trajectory asked for |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| `True` (default) | 21 increments, paced | same |
| `False` | one write per motor | same |
| `0`, `""`, `None`, `[]` | one write per motor | the default, interpolated |
| `"false"`, `"no"`, `"off"`, `"0"` | 21 increments, paced | one write per motor |

The falsy half is the sharper one, because this flag defaults to `True`: it
*removes* an interpolation the caller never asked to leave, and what reaches the
bus is a single write to the far end of the travel - the full-travel jump this
tool already refuses `steps=True` for. The flag also decides whether `steps` and
`step_delay` are read at all, so `smooth="false", steps=0` was refused for
`steps` - an option the caller's own posture said nobody would read.

Both halves are now refused against the shared boolean domain, ahead of the
`steps` / `step_delay` check so a bad flag is named as the flag. Only
`"load_pose"` and `"move_multiple"` consult it: `"reset_to_home"` interpolates
unconditionally and supplies its own, and every other action moves in one shot,
so none of them is refused for it. The two declared postures are unchanged.

### A mesh wait budget is bounded where the command body cannot carry it

`robot_mesh` takes four numeric options. `duration` and `policy_port` travel
inside the command body that
[`validate_command`](../security/commands.md#payload-validation) inspects, so that validator already bounds
them. `timeout` and `limit` never enter a command body, so they are bounded by
the tool:

| Option | Accepted | Why the floor is where it is |
|--------|----------|------------------------------|
| `timeout` | positive finite number | it becomes a `threading.Event` wait; `0`/negative/`nan` return from that wait immediately, so the tool reports `{"status": "timeout"}` for a peer it never gave the chance to answer, and `inf` overflows the deadline |
| `limit` | positive integer | it is a slice index into the `inbox` buffer; a non-positive or `nan` value selected the *whole* buffer, and a fractional one raised out of the dispatcher |

`stop` additionally caps `timeout` at 5s so a stop cannot hang, but the cap
cannot replace the domain: `min(nan, 5.0)` is `nan`, so `nan` passed straight
through it.

The same scoping rule applies: `timeout` is read by `tell` / `send` / `rpc` /
`broadcast` / `stop`, `limit` only by `inbox`, and the rest are never refused
for either. `emergency_stop` fans out on a fixed internal budget, so the
caller's `timeout` is not effective there.

## Calibration

No tool here calibrates. Recording a calibration means disabling torque and
moving one physical arm by hand, and LeRobot ships that procedure as its own
console scripts:

```bash
lerobot-find-port                                       # which bus is the arm on
lerobot-setup-motors --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0
lerobot-calibrate    --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
                     --robot.id=my_arm
```

The result is JSON under `HF_LEROBOT_CALIBRATION` (by default
`~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration/`). `lerobot_teleoperate` and
`lerobot_train` read it through LeRobot; `lerobot-find-joint-limits` reports the
travel a recorded calibration allows.

Two surfaces here read that file directly, and both take the same argument:
`FeetechDriver(calibration=...)` and `pose_tool(calibration=...)`, each the path
of the JSON that run wrote. It is the scale, not a refinement - a degree is
`360/resolution` counts from the middle of the *measured* travel, and percent
open spans the gripper's measured travel - so the number a calibrated arm quotes
through either surface is the number LeRobot quotes for the same servo. Omitting
it reads and commands the servo's whole rotation, which is off by however far
that arm's stops sit inside it, and bounds a target by the encoder rather than by
where the joint stops. A per-joint degree range is deliberately not declared
anywhere in the package: an SO arm's reachable span is measured per arm.

## Examples

```python
result = serial_tool(action="list_ports")
print(result["content"][0]["text"])

result = lerobot_camera(action="list", camera_type="opencv")
result = pose_tool(action="read_all", robot_id="so101_follower", port="/dev/ttyACM0")

# DAgger / teleop takeover: a policy drives the follower while the leader can
# pre-empt to record corrections (appended to the dataset as new episodes).
# Drives lerobot-rollout with --strategy.type=dagger.
result = lerobot_teleoperate(
    action="dagger",
    robot_type="so101_follower", robot_port="/dev/ttyACM0",
    teleop_type="so101_leader", teleop_port="/dev/ttyACM1",
    policy_path="user/act_fold",            # policy to roll out
    dataset_repo_id="user/fold_corrections",
    dataset_single_task="fold the towel",
    dagger_num_episodes=10,                  # cap collected corrections
)
```

## Use with an agent

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_robots import Robot
from strands_robots import lerobot_camera, pose_tool, serial_tool

agent = Agent(tools=[
    Robot("so100"),
    lerobot_camera, pose_tool, serial_tool,
])
agent("Find a connected so100, calibrate it, then stream the wrist camera for 10 seconds")
```
