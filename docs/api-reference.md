## `strands_robots.registry`

```python
from strands_robots.registry import (
    list_robots, resolve_name, get_robot, has_sim, has_hardware, get_hardware_type,
    list_robots_by_category, list_aliases, normalize_robot_name, format_robot_table,
    register_robot, unregister_robot, list_user_robots,
    user_registry_source, parse_user_robots,
    list_policy_providers, resolve_policy, build_policy_kwargs,
)
```

| Symbol | What |
|--------|------|
| `list_robots(mode)` | Robots filtered on backend support, not on category: `"all"`, `"sim"` (has a simulation asset), `"real"` (has a hardware backend) or `"both"`. An unrecognized mode raises rather than returning the unfiltered list. To group by category use `list_robots_by_category()`. |
| `resolve_name(name)` | Alias → canonical name. The query is folded by `normalize_robot_name` first, so any spelling of a name or alias reaches the same robot. |
| `get_robot(name)` | Full registry entry dict. |
| `has_sim(name)` / `has_hardware(name)` | Sim / real support flags. |
| `get_hardware_type(name)` | LeRobot type string for `mode="real"`. |
| `list_robots_by_category()` | Group name to the `list_robots()` records in it. Every robot is in exactly one group, so the group sizes sum to `len(list_robots())`. `category` is optional, so a robot that declares none is grouped under `"other"` rather than under a nameless group, and a declared name is stripped of surrounding whitespace so a padded spelling joins its own group. `list_robots()` still reports each robot's own `category` exactly as its entry declares it. |
| `list_aliases()` | All 121 aliases, keyed by `normalize_robot_name` (so every key is a spelling a folded query can produce), including every GR00T `data_config` spelling (so `data_config` names resolve as robot names). |
| `normalize_robot_name(name)` | The fold every registry lookup applies: lowercase, trimmed, dashes as underscores. Canonical names, aliases and the uniqueness constraints over both are all keyed by it, so this is the rule that predicts which robot a name reaches. |
| `format_robot_table()` | Pretty-printed robot table. |
| `register_robot(name, *, model_xml, ...)` | Add user-defined robot at runtime. Every field after `name` is keyword-only. `model_xml`/`scene_xml` must name a file inside `asset_dir`. Values must be JSON types (a `Path` or a numpy scalar in `hardware` is refused, naming the offending type). |
| `unregister_robot(name)` | Remove a runtime-registered robot. |
| Both write the whole overlay | `user_robots.json` is read, changed and stored back in one atomic commit, so a refused or failed write leaves every previously registered robot exactly as it was rather than truncating the document they all share. |
| `list_user_robots()` | Names from `register_robot`. |
| `user_registry_source()` | Raw bytes of `user_robots.json`, or `None` when absent. What the loader keys its hot-reload cache on, so an edit by another writer is seen even when it lands inside one filesystem timestamp tick. |
| `parse_user_robots(source)` | Robot definitions held in those bytes; empty when absent or malformed. Parsing the bytes the cache was keyed on is what keeps the cached merge and the key describing the same overlay. |
| `list_policy_providers()` | Providers from `policies.json`, canonical names only. |
| `list_policy_aliases()` | Alias/shorthand -> canonical provider, from `policies.json`. Peer of `list_aliases()` for robots. |
| `resolve_policy(uri)` | URI → provider name. |
| `build_policy_kwargs(provider, **kw)` | Normalise + validate kwargs. An explicit value beats the provider's registry default; the provider's own key (`host=`) beats the generic parameter (`policy_host=`). Every generic parameter defaults to `None`, meaning "unset", so an omitted one leaves the provider's own default -- registry, else constructor -- in place. |

## `strands_robots.simulation`

```python
from strands_robots.simulation import (
    Simulation, SimWorld, SimRobot, SimObject, SimCamera,
    create_simulation, list_backends, register_backend,
)
from strands_robots.simulation.base import SimEngine
```

| Symbol | What |
|--------|------|
| `Simulation` | MuJoCo backend - 60+ agent actions. |
| `SimWorld`, `SimRobot`, `SimObject`, `SimCamera` | Shared dataclasses. |
| `create_simulation(backend='mujoco')` | Factory for non-`Robot()` construction. |
| `list_backends()` / `register_backend(name, loader)` | Backend registry. `loader` is a zero-arg callable returning the class (`lambda: MyEngine`), so the import stays deferred. |
| `SimEngine` | ABC custom backends implement. |

Selected actions:

| Action | What |
|--------|------|
| `run_policy(robot_name, ...)` | Blocking policy rollout. |
| `start_policy(robot_name, ...)` | Rollout in a background thread on MuJoCo; a blocking passthrough to `run_policy` on the other backends. `describe()['methods']['start_policy']` states which one the engine you hold implements. |
| `stop_policy(robot_name)` | Cooperatively stop a rollout, then wait (bounded, 1 s) for its worker to exit, so the caller's next action on that robot is admitted. The `json` block reports `was_running` and `exited`: `true` when the worker was joined and is gone, `false` when it is still live after that budget (the text says so, and names the action that stays refused), `null` when there was nothing to join - no rollout, or a blocking `run_policy` driven on its caller's own thread. An empty `robot_name` means the only rollout in flight, and is otherwise refused naming what is running. Refused (naming the class) by a backend with no durable per-robot claim. |
| `run_multi_policy(policies, ...)` | Synchronized multi-robot rollout, one merged frame per step. |
| `eval_policy(robot_name, n_episodes, ...)` | Multi-episode evaluation. |
| `evaluate_benchmark(benchmark_name, ...)` | Run registered benchmark. |
| `list_benchmarks()` / `register_benchmark_from_file(name, spec_path)` | Benchmark registry. |
| `replay_episode(repo_id, robot_name, ...)` | Replay a recorded episode. |

## `strands_robots.hardware_robot`

```python
from strands_robots.hardware_robot import Robot, TaskStatus, RobotTaskState
```

| Symbol | What |
|--------|------|
| `Robot` | Real-hardware AgentTool. |
| `TaskStatus` | Enum: `IDLE` / `CONNECTING` / `RUNNING` / `COMPLETED` / `STOPPED` / `ERROR`. |
| `RobotTaskState` | Dataclass: status, step count, error. |

| Method | What |
|--------|------|
| `start_task(instruction, policy_port, ...)` | Async task start. |
| `stop_task()` | Halt the current task, including one still in `CONNECTING`. |
| `get_task_status()` | Return `RobotTaskState`. |
| `cleanup()` | Stop tasks, disconnect the motors bus and cameras, stop mesh. |

## `strands_robots.policies`

```python
from strands_robots.policies import (
    Policy, MockPolicy, create_policy, import_policy_class, register_policy, list_providers,
    UntrustedRemoteCodeError,
)
from strands_robots.policies.groot import Gr00tPolicy
from strands_robots.policies.lerobot_local import LerobotLocalPolicy
from strands_robots.policies.cosmos3 import Cosmos3Policy
```

| Symbol | What |
|--------|------|
| `Policy` | ABC: `get_actions`, `set_robot_state_keys`, `requires_images`, `provider_name`. |
| `MockPolicy` | Sinusoidal mock. `requires_images=False`. |
| `create_policy(provider, **kw)` | Resolve + construct. Accepts `zmq://`, `cosmos3://`, HF `org/model`. |
| `import_policy_class(provider)` | Lazy import of a provider's class: the registry entry's module, else auto-discovery of `strands_robots.policies.<provider>`. Raises `ImportError` naming the extra when the module's optional dependency is absent, `ValueError` when no provider resolves. |
| `register_policy(name, loader, aliases)` | Runtime registration. |
| `list_providers()` | Sorted canonical names of every JSON-registered provider, plus any runtime `register_policy` names and their aliases. Canonical names only for the JSON registry: pair it with `list_aliases()` for the rest. |
| `list_aliases()` | Every provider alias and the canonical name it resolves to, across both registries. Together with `list_providers()` they are every *registered* spelling - not every spelling `create_policy` resolves. A module under `strands_robots.policies` exporting a `Policy` subclass also resolves under its own module name: `composite` (builds through the factory) and `persistent` (resolves; constructed directly). |
| `list_policy_types()` | `policy_type` strings the installed lerobot resolves; `[]` without lerobot. Discovery peer of `list_providers`. |
| `UntrustedRemoteCodeError` | Raised when `STRANDS_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE` is required but unset. |
| `Gr00tPolicy` | GR00T N1.5/N1.6/N1.7 via ZMQ (service) or in-process. |
| `LerobotLocalPolicy` | HF LeRobot inference (ACT, Pi0, Pi0.5, SmolVLA, …). Needs `STRANDS_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE=1`. |
| `Cosmos3Policy` | NVIDIA Cosmos 3 VLA over WebSocket. |

## `strands_robots.tools`

```python
from strands_robots import (
    download_assets, gr00t_inference, lerobot_camera, lerobot_teleoperate,
    lerobot_train, pose_tool, robot_mesh, run_policy,
    serial_tool, train_policy, use_lerobot, use_ros, use_rtps,
)
# Each tool lives in a submodule of the same name (strands_robots.tools.use_ros),
# so read it off the package root as above or off its own submodule
# (from strands_robots.tools.use_ros import use_ros); never off strands_robots.tools,
# where the name is the submodule once anything has imported it.
# All return {"status": "...", "content": [{"text": "..."}]}
```

See [Hardware tools](hardware/tools.md).

## `strands_robots.dataset_recorder`

```python
from strands_robots.dataset_recorder import DatasetRecorder, has_lerobot_dataset
```

| Symbol | What |
|--------|------|
| `DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id, fps, ...)` | New dataset. |
| `DatasetRecorder.resume(repo_id, root, task, ...)` | Append to existing (`lerobot>=0.5.2`). |
| `recorder.add_frame(observation, action, task=...)` | Append one frame. |
| `recorder.save_episode()` | Finalise episode. |
| `recorder.clear_episode_buffer()` | Discard buffer. |
| `recorder.finalize()` | Flush and close. |
| `recorder.push_to_hub(tags=None, private=False)` | Upload to HuggingFace. `private` must be a boolean — it selects the repo's visibility. |
| `has_lerobot_dataset()` | Cached import check (True if `LeRobotDataset` imports). |
| `lerobot_dataset_import_error()` | `None` if it imports, else why not - names the missing package and the install that supplies it. Use this when reporting to a human. |

## `strands_robots.mesh`

```python
from strands_robots.mesh import init_mesh, Mesh, InputPublisher, InputReceiver
```

| Symbol | What |
|--------|------|
| `init_mesh(robot, peer_id=None, ...)` | Attach mesh to a robot instance. |
| `Mesh` | `peer_id`, `peers`, `alive`, `send`, `broadcast`, `tell`, `emergency_stop`. |
| `InputPublisher` | Stream teleoperator actions over mesh. |
| `InputReceiver` | Receive + apply remote teleoperator actions. |
