"""Distribution is a property of the ``test`` script, not of the repository.

``hatch run test`` spreads the unit suite over the cores with ``-n auto --dist
loadfile``. Those flags could equally sit in ``[tool.pytest.ini_options].addopts``,
and that is where a first cut put them -- but ``addopts`` is read by every
pytest invocation rooted here, ``hatch run test-integ`` included, and the
integration suite is the one population that cannot run two files at once:
its cells bind fixed ports and named containers, hold the one GPU, and open
physical serial buses. Distributing it silently would have been a default
changed on a path nothing measured, with two writers on one arm as the failure.

So the split pinned here is: the ``test`` script asks for the distribution, and
nothing an invocation inherits does. A bare ``pytest`` and ``test-integ`` stay in
one process until someone asks for otherwise on the command line.
