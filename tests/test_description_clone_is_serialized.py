"""No two callers of one description cache are inside the clone at once.

Importing ``robot_descriptions.<name>_mj_description`` clones an upstream
repository into a shared cache directory, and 40-odd descriptions name one
``mujoco_menagerie``. Upstream's ``clone_to_directory`` tests that directory for
a usable clone and then creates it, holding no lock, so two callers inside that
window both clone into one directory and the loser's ``git`` fails in a tree the
winner is building - reported as the robot's own download failure.

CPython's import lock does not close the window: it is per module, and the
colliding callers import *different* descriptions that share one repository.
So the four places the package triggers a clone all route through
:func:`strands_robots._description_cache.import_description`, and the cells
below grade that: each entry point is driven from two threads importing two
descriptions whose imports report whether they overlapped, the scan pins that no
fifth call site can skip the lock, and the two degraded conditions still import.

A test module is the other half of the window: it reaches a description through
its own ``pytest.importorskip("robot_descriptions.<name>")``, which no package
seam sees, and a distributed run collects every file in every worker. So
:mod:`tests.description_clone_lock` wraps ``clone_to_cache`` itself in *this*
module's lock for the session, and the last two cells grade that the two halves
wait on one lock file rather than on one each.
