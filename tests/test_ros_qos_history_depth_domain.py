"""The QoS history depth a ROS 2 bridge publishes with is checked where it is given.

``RosTelemetryBridge`` and its hardware subclass take a ``qos_depth`` and hand it
to ``create_publisher`` / ``create_subscription`` as rclpy's ``qos_or_depth``
argument, which becomes ``QoSProfile(depth=value, history=KEEP_LAST)``. It is the
one constructor parameter of that pair whose consumer is not reached from the
constructor: the publishers are built lazily, on the first
``publish_joint_states`` / ``publish_image`` for a robot. Every sibling parameter
is measured at the boundary - ``domain_id`` against the RTPS port map,
``spin_period`` against the positive finite domain, ``enable_commands`` against
the boolean domain, ``joint_limits`` against a finite numeric pair - and this one
was handed through unchecked.

Measured against rclpy on ROS 2 Jazzy, every unusable spelling constructed a
bridge that reported success:

* ``0`` and ``False`` were **accepted** by rclpy, which warns "A zero depth with
  KEEP_LAST doesn't make sense; no data could be stored. This will be
  interpreted as SYSTEM_DEFAULT" and builds the publisher with the middleware
  default. So the declared depth was silently not the depth in force, reported
  by a ``UserWarning`` that ``warnings.warn`` shows once per location - a second
  bridge in the same process said nothing at all. ``True`` was accepted as a
  silent depth of 1.
* ``-1`` raised ``ValueError: history depth must be greater than or equal to
  zero``, and ``2.5`` / ``"10"`` / ``None`` / ``nan`` / ``inf`` /
  ``np.int64(10)`` raised ``TypeError: Expected QoSProfile or int`` - from inside
  rclpy, naming neither the parameter nor the bridge, and on the telemetry-only
  path not until the first frame was published. On the command path
  ``create_subscription`` runs in the constructor, so the same mistake raised
  there instead, after the process-wide ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` write and after the
  node was created.

Nothing observed any of it. ``qos_depth`` appeared in no test, no doc and no
example, and the only rclpy double in the suite that reaches ``create_publisher``
takes the depth as ``_depth`` and discards it, so no existing test could see
which depth an endpoint was built with. The double below records it instead,
which is what lets the accepted-value control assert that a depth reaches the
transport verbatim.

``rclpy`` is optional and not installable from PyPI, so every refusal test here
runs with it absent: the guard is placed ahead of the transport probe, which is
what makes that possible and is asserted directly.
