"""A real robot tool refusing a verb it does not have names where that verb lives.

``Robot(mode="real")`` publishes the observe verbs (get_state, get_robot_state,
list_cameras, render) and the motion/task ones (execute, start, status, stop). The
quickstart once asked it, in one prompt, for ``start_recording``, ``teleoperate``
and ``stop_recording`` - every call came back "Unknown action" with nothing about
where the verb went. Measured against the simulation tool's 77 published actions,
the three land in three different places: ``start_recording`` / ``stop_recording``
are its actions, ``teleoperate`` is not an action of either tool but a Python
method of the teleop mixin, and the recording of a real arm under a leader is the
``lerobot_teleoperate`` tool.

A fourth place is this tool itself. ``run_policy`` is both a simulation tool
action and a Python method of this class, and it is what this tool does - under
the names ``execute`` and ``start`` - so refusing it without saying so
contradicts the refusal's own opening ("so101 drives policies").

The refusal now names the destination for each group, an unknown spelling still
gets the plain refusal byte for byte, and building it cannot raise on the value
it reports. The quickstart itself is pinned here to verbs the tool it hands the
agent actually has.
