"""``strands-robots doctor`` releases the sim its smoke test opened.

``check_sim_smoke`` drives ``Robot('so100')`` through ``step`` and
``get_observation``, and that observation renders the robot's cameras, so it
opens a MuJoCo GL context. Left to the finalizer, that context is freed during
interpreter teardown - after EGL has already been de-initialised - and MuJoCo's
own ``Renderer.__del__`` writes an ``Exception ignored in`` traceback to stderr.

The command that wrote it still exits 0 and still prints "All checks passed", so
the reader of a first-run diagnostic is handed a wall of EGL tracebacks beside
the verdict that says their setup is sound. The renderer is therefore released
where the check opened it.

The scope here is that release. Whether the surrounding command reports its
findings well, and what a *failing* check should say, are the sibling suite's
questions and are unchanged by these cells.
