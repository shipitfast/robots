"""The custom-policy walkthrough's ``MyPolicy`` must act on the keys it is given.

``SimEngine.run_policy`` calls ``policy.set_robot_state_keys(robot_action_keys)``
before the rollout, and ``PolicyRunner`` refuses a policy whose first three
actions resolve to no actuator on the robot (``"the robot has not moved"``). The
``docs/policies/custom-policies.md`` opening fence is the reader's first policy
and is run on ``Robot("so100")`` two fences later, so the action it returns must
be keyed by the names ``set_robot_state_keys`` received, not by literals no arm
carries.

This executes the fence's class with ``register_policy`` stubbed, hands it the
SO-100's action keys the way the runtime does, and grades the first action.
