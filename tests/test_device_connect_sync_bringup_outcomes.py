"""What ``init_device_connect_sync`` tells its caller about a bring-up.

The wrapper starts :func:`strands_robots.device_connect.init_device_connect` on a
daemon thread and bounds the wait, so the bring-up has exactly three outcomes:
it completes, it fails, or the budget expires. All three have to be
distinguishable by the caller -- the return type is a ``DeviceRuntime``, not an
optional one, and ``strands_robots.robot``'s foreground runner wraps the call in
``except Exception`` precisely so a failed bring-up is reported rather than
printing an "is online" line for a runtime that never came up.

The two failure outcomes cross a thread boundary, which is why they are pinned
here: the recorded exception is re-raised on the caller's thread, and an expired
budget raises rather than handing back the ``None`` the holder still contains. A
bring-up that finishes without returning a runtime leaves that same empty holder,
so it is reported the same way -- an empty holder is a failed bring-up however it
came to be empty, and returning it would be the one outcome a caller cannot act
on, indistinguishable from a runtime that came up.

A bring-up that produced no runtime also has machinery to give back. The loop and
the thread are handed to the caller by being adopted onto the returned runtime, so
with no runtime there is nothing to adopt them and nothing to serve on them either
-- which is why the release is graded here alongside the exception, rather than
left to a caller that has no handle to release.

Nothing here needs a broker, a Docker stack or the Kit runtime: the awaited half
is substituted, and the wrapper's budget is a module attribute so the expiry
arm resolves in milliseconds instead of the shipped 30 seconds.
