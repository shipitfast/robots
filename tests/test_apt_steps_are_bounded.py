"""An ``apt-get`` step in CI cannot stall past a bound that names it.

``call-test-lint / Test and Lint`` reported ``FAILURE`` having never run a test,
twice inside one 80-minute window.  Both jobs were reaped by the job's own
``timeout-minutes: 45`` while still inside step 4, ``Install system
dependencies (OpenGL for MuJoCo)`` -- measured from the attempt-1 job records::

    run           subject                  step 4      duration   lint / tests
    32163486141   main @ 74d078ab (push)   cancelled   45m12s     skipped
    32165565982   #2440 @ 2c489f92 (PR)    cancelled   45m11s     skipped

Steps 1-3 succeeded in both, steps 5-9 are ``skipped`` in both, and both jobs
ran 45m23s -- the job ceiling, not a decision either step made.  Two runners,
overlapping windows, the same wedge point.  See #2442.

Two distinct bounds are missing, and each covers a case the other cannot.

**A retry loop driven by an exit status cannot survive a hang.**  The step
already anticipates a bad mirror and retries, but the loop reads *what apt-get
returned*::

    for attempt in 1 2 3; do
      if sudo apt-get update; then break; fi
      echo "apt-get update failed (attempt ${attempt}/3), retrying in 5s..."
      sleep 5
    done

A mirror that answers wrongly exits 100 and is retried.  A mirror that never
answers leaves the ``if`` unevaluated: attempt 2 is never reached, the backoff
never runs, and the ``echo`` that would have named apt never prints -- so the
log simply stops mid-step and the failure is silent as well as slow.  Wrapping
the command in ``timeout`` converts the hang into exit 124, which is the
failure the loop already handles.  A step-level bound cannot substitute here:
it kills the step rather than the attempt, so the loop still never retries.

**A step-level bound is what makes the reap legible.**  A job-level reap
cancels whatever step is running and aggregates to ``FAILURE`` carrying no
reason -- the same false red #1800/#2304 documented for concurrency cancels,
from a third producer that their ``github.sha`` keying does not touch.  A
step-level ``timeout-minutes`` fires first and marks the step, so the verdict
reads "the mirror is wedged" instead of "something in your diff".

**The bounds are sized from measured runs, and the ceiling is not the tight
end.**  #2442 suggested ``timeout 180`` for ``update`` and ``timeout 300`` for
``install``.  Over 31 successful ``Test and Lint`` jobs the apt step ran p50
33s, p90 264s, max 455s, with 7 runs above 180s and 5 of those *outside* the
incident window -- so a 300s bound on ``install`` would have reaped healthy
runs.  Reading the slowest one's log (job 95914546572, step 455s) splits the
cost: ``apt-get update`` finished in ~5s and the remaining ~449s was
``apt-get install`` fetching ffmpeg's ~115 packages.  The same tail appears in
``agent-api-check.yml``, whose apt step installs no ffmpeg and still ran 474s
once over 30 runs against a p50 of 15s.

So the two commands want different treatment, which is why this contract does
not simply demand ``timeout`` everywhere: ``update`` is bounded per attempt
because that is the command the loop retries and its honest cost is seconds,
while ``install`` is bounded by the step, because any per-command bound tight
enough to be useful is inside the healthy distribution.

**A bound needs something to act on the exit it produces.**  The first push of
this change bounded ``agent-api-check.yml``'s ``apt-get update`` without giving
it the loop, and CI produced the stall on that very step: the
``azure.archive.ubuntu.com`` mirror was ignored after three tries, the fallback
to ``archive.ubuntu.com`` then went **silent for 142s** mid-``InRelease``, and
the bound ended it at 180s -- correctly, but with nothing to retry it, so a
transient stall read as a hard red.  ``timeout`` converts a hang into exit 124
and that is all it does; the recovery is the loop.  Hence the pairing is the
contract: a bounded apt-get sits in a loop that reads its status, and the loop
is what makes fast failure recoverable rather than merely faster.

What is asserted, therefore:

1. every step that runs ``apt-get`` declares a literal ``timeout-minutes``,
   strictly less than its job's, so the step owns the reap and names itself;
2. every ``apt-get`` whose exit status drives a loop condition carries a
   literal ``timeout``, so a hang becomes the failure the loop handles;
3. each such ``timeout`` is smaller than its own step's bound, or it could
   never fire.

Parsing is deliberately line-based rather than via ``yaml``: ``tests/`` is
type-checked under ``ignore_missing_imports = false`` and ``types-PyYAML`` is
not a dev dependency, so importing it would either fail ``mypy`` or require a
dependency change and a ``uv.lock`` relock.  The neighbouring workflow contract
pins (``tests/test_workflow_jobs_are_bounded.py``,
``tests/test_codeql_query_filters.py``) read their YAML the same way, and
``TestTheParserActuallySeesTheApt`` cross-checks the parse against a raw text
scan so a parser that silently stops matching fails instead of passing
vacuously.
