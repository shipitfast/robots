"""An MP4 request without an MP4 backend is refused as the missing dependency.

:func:`~strands_robots.rendering.encode_clip` probes ``imageio`` before it
writes, and ``imageio`` is not one dependency but two: the package itself, and
the plugin that actually encodes the container. ``imageio`` declares that plugin
-- ``imageio_ffmpeg`` -- as an optional extra of its own, so an install can
supply the module ``encode_clip`` imports and still have no MP4 writer behind
it. Every extra here declares both, but nothing stops a caller installing
``imageio`` on its own - and an extra that declared it alone once shipped.

With the plugin absent ``imageio`` does not refuse the ``.mp4`` request. It
falls through to whatever other plugin claims the container, and the libx264
knobs then reach a writer that has never heard of them, so the request fails as
``PyAVPlugin.write() got an unexpected keyword argument 'quality'`` -- or
``TiffWriter.write() got an unexpected keyword argument 'fps'`` when PyAV is
absent too. That is a ``TypeError`` naming a writer the caller never asked for,
and it is neither what ``encode_clip`` documents (``ImportError``) nor what its
callers handle:

* ``SimulationRendering._flush_cameras_recording_state`` (MuJoCo) has one
  ``except ImportError`` branch that keeps the recording registered with every
  buffered frame, so the caller can install the encoder and stop again. A
  ``TypeError`` misses it, lands in the best-effort ``except Exception``, and
  the frames are dropped under ``status="success"`` instead.
* ``IsaacSimulation.stop_cameras_recording`` documents that it never raises,
  and catches ``ImportError``, ``RuntimeError`` and ``ValueError``. A
  ``TypeError`` escapes the tool envelope entirely -- after the recording state
  has already been cleared, so no second stop can recover the buffers.

The rollout recorder is the third writer with the same shape:
``_RolloutVideoWriter.open`` probed ``imageio`` and then handed
``imageio.get_writer`` the same libx264 knobs, which is the path
``run_policy(video=...)`` takes, with an ``.mp4`` default.

So the container decides which modules have to be present, one place decides it
(:func:`~strands_robots.rendering.require_clip_encoder`), and every writer routes
its probe through that instead of repeating the rule -- which is how the rule
came to hold for one writer and not the next. GIF needs no plugin (Pillow writes
it, ``imageio`` hard-requires Pillow and this package depends on it outright),
which is the control here: the same absent plugin must leave a GIF encode
working.

The second half is the report. Both flushes used to answer with a fixed
``"imageio not installed. pip install imageio imageio-ffmpeg"`` line, which
names the wrong module whenever it is the plugin that is missing, and hands over
two unbounded distributions instead of the extra whose bounds this project owns.
They quote the encoder's own refusal now, which ``require_optional`` builds from
the module actually absent.
