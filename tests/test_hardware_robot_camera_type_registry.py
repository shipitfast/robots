"""The camera ``type`` a hardware ``Robot`` accepts is lerobot's own registry.

``Robot(..., cameras={"top": {"type": ..., ...}})`` describes each camera with a
serialized lerobot ``CameraConfig``: ``type`` is draccus' choice discriminator
(``CameraConfig.type`` returns ``get_choice_name(cls)``) and the remaining keys
are fields of the class it selects. So the set of accepted ``type`` values must
be ``CameraConfig.get_known_choices()`` -- the same ``ChoiceRegistry`` lookup
``_create_minimal_config`` already uses for ``robot_type``, and the one
``lerobot.cameras.make_cameras_from_configs`` dispatches on.

Pre-fix the builder resolved ``OpenCVCameraConfig`` unconditionally and refused
every other ``type``, so a RealSense, a ZMQ stream and a Reachy 2 camera were
all unattachable through the factory -- while ``tools/lerobot_camera`` in this
same package opens a RealSense, and the docs' real-mode examples name
``realsense_top``. Every cell here fails on that builder.

The choices are populated lazily, which is the other half of the fix: importing
``lerobot.cameras`` registers nothing at all (pinned below), so a registry
lookup that skips the subpackage walk reports every camera type as unknown.

No camera hardware and no vendor SDK is touched: only config dataclasses are
constructed.
