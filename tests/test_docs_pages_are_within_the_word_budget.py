"""A documentation page stays under 1,500 words, or is named as still owing a split.

A page that grows past a reading's worth of text stops being read: the reference
material a caller needs is buried under prose the code already states, and the
next writer appends rather than replaces. ``docs/recording.md`` reached 9,924
words across 58 headings - record, verify and replay in one scroll - before it
was split.

The budget is graded as a ratchet rather than a flat rule, because the site
still carries pages that owe the same treatment. :data:`_OVER_BUDGET` names
them, and the second test refuses a stale entry: a page that has been trimmed
must leave the list, so the exemption cannot outlive the page it excuses and the
list can only shrink.

Words are counted the way the budget is stated - ``str.split()`` over the whole
file, front matter and fences included - so the number here is the number
``wc -w`` prints for the same path.
