"""``resume`` and ``streaming`` on a TrainSpec are checked, never read by truthiness.

Each of the two selects a *posture* - continue the run under ``output_dir`` or
start it fresh; stream the dataset or materialize it - and every backend that
read either did so by truthiness. Every non-empty string is truthy, so the
spellings a caller reaches for when opting out (``"false"``, ``"no"``, ``"0"``)
selected the affirmative posture, and ``0``, ``None`` and ``""`` selected the
negative one without being a declared spelling of it. Measured on ``d2f23d8``:

* ``TrainSpec(resume="false")`` with a checkpoint under ``output_dir`` made
  LeRobot's ``build_config`` return the checkpoint's own ``train_config.json``
  in place of a config built from the spec, so the fresh run that was asked for
  became a resume of a previous configuration and the spec's ``steps``,
  ``global_batch_size`` and ``save_freq`` never reached it - the defect
  ``tests/tools/test_lerobot_train_flag_domain.py`` closed on the sibling tool,
  still reachable through the provider-agnostic ``train_policy`` one layer up;
* ``TrainSpec(streaming="false", val_episodes=2)`` was refused by LeRobot's
  ``validate`` with "set streaming=False to keep the validation split", a remedy
  the caller had already spelled - the flag *gates* the pair check, so a
  misread posture was reported as the option it selected rather than as itself;
* GR00T emitted ``--resume_from_checkpoint`` for ``resume="false"``, and
  SageMaker forwarded the raw string as a hyperparameter.

The fields are held to the shared :func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error`
domain through two field-scoped gates on :class:`~strands_robots.training.base.Trainer`,
in the same biconditional as the numeric domains beside them: a backend that
reads the field routes it through the gate, and a backend that ignores the field
reports nothing about it. Two gates rather than one because the readers differ -
GR00T reads ``resume`` and ignores ``streaming``.
