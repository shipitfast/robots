"""FastSAC's second learning rate is checked against the same domain as its first.

FastSAC builds two optimizers from two separate learning-rate fields::

    self.actor_optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(actor_params, lr=spec.learning_rate)
    self.critic_optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(critic_params, lr=spec.learning_rate)
    ...
    self.alpha_optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([self.log_alpha], lr=spec.alpha_lr)

``learning_rate`` went through the shared optimization gate; ``alpha_lr`` - which
``RLTrainSpec`` documents as the "Learning rate for the temperature optimizer
(SAC)" - reached the same constructor unchecked, so every failure mode that gate
documents stayed reachable through the second field. Measured on a 40-timestep
run starting from ``init_alpha=1.0``: ``alpha_lr=0`` builds the optimizer and
moves the temperature by nothing, so ``autotune_alpha=True`` silently behaves
like ``autotune_alpha=False``; ``inf`` sends it to an infinity on the first step
and, because the temperature multiplies the log-probability in the *actor* loss,
the run finished ``status="success"`` with a checkpoint whose largest parameter
magnitude was ``inf``; ``True`` was a silent rate of ``1.0``. A negative value
and ``nan`` are refused by ``torch.optim.Adam``, and a ``str`` / ``None`` /
``list`` raises a bare ``TypeError``, but all four only in ``setup`` - after the
env and both networks are built.

Scoped twice over: only the off-policy backend tunes a temperature, and within it
only the ``autotune_alpha`` branch builds the optimizer, so both the other
backends and a spec that tunes nothing must stay quiet. Every test reaches the
real ``validate`` entry point, so the wiring is covered as well as the domain.
