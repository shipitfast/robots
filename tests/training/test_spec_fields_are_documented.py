"""Every training spec field is named by the surface that governs it.

An agent populates :class:`~strands_robots.training.base.TrainSpec` (or its RL
subclass) field by field from the class docstring, and a backend that reads a
field preflights it through the matching ``Trainer._*_problems`` gate. Both
surfaces are prose, so both can silently stop naming a field the code still
reads - an undocumented field is one an agent cannot populate, and a gate that
does not name the field it grades sends a refused caller to the wrong knob.

This scans the docstrings against the dataclass fields and the ``_validate``
gates, so a field added without an ``Attributes`` entry, or a gate whose
docstring no longer names its field, fails here.
