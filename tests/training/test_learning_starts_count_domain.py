"""``learning_starts`` is a count, so FastSAC asks it of the count domain.

``learning_starts`` is one side of the relation ``learning_starts >= batch_size``,
and that relation was the only thing standing between the field and its two
consumers. The relation's *other* operand was already asked of
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error` before being compared; this
one was not, on the stated grounds that it is "one side of a relation rather than
a bare count". That reason is about the shape of the *rule* and says nothing
about whether the value is a count at all, and a comparison is not a domain: a
non-finite value compares False against every ``int`` (nothing is greater than
``nan``, and ``inf`` is below no integer), so the relation passed and reported
nothing.

Both consumers then read a value that is not a count.
:meth:`~strands_robots.training.rl.fast_sac.FastSacTrainer.collect_rollout` tests
``buffer.size < learning_starts`` to decide whether to draw a random warmup
action, and ``train`` tests ``buffer.size >= learning_starts`` to decide whether
``update()`` runs at all. Measured on the MuJoCo reach env used by
``tests/training/test_rl_fast_sac.py`` (40 timesteps, ``rollout_steps=10``,
``batch_size=16``, ``gradient_steps=2``, one field mutated):

=========================  ==========  ========  =====================
``learning_starts``        ``validate``  ``train``  ``update()`` calls
=========================  ==========  ========  =====================
``16`` (a real count)      ``[]``      success   3
``float("nan")``           ``[]``      success   **0**
``float("inf")``           ``[]``      success   **0**
=========================  ==========  ========  =====================

So the run built the environment, the networks, the optimizers and the replay
buffer, collected every rollout, wrote a checkpoint and reported
``status="success"`` having taken no gradient step at all. That is the outcome
``_rl_replay_problems`` exists to refuse for ``buffer_size`` - its docstring
records the same "zero gradient updates, yet the run reported success" - reached
through the field its scope line excluded. ``nan`` additionally skips the random
warmup the field exists to provide, so the untrained actor drives from step one.

The domain applied here is the strict-``int``
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error` the relation's other operand
already uses, so the relation now compares two values drawn from one domain. Two
consequences of *strict*, both deliberate and pinned below: an integral float
such as ``1000.0`` and a ``numpy`` integer are now refused although the bare
comparison accepted them, because the field is annotated ``int`` and a relation
between a strict count and a loose one is the drift this closes; and a very large
``int`` is still accepted, because magnitude is not the axis - ``10**400`` is a
count, and a run that has not reached it has genuinely not finished warming up.

The scope of the *gate* is unchanged: ``_rl_replay_problems`` still reports
nothing about this field, because PPO reads neither it nor the three replay
counts. ``tests/training/test_rl_replay_domain.py`` pins that, and this file
grades the domain FastSAC asks of the field in its own ``validate``.
