"""The on-policy optimization-epoch count is checked against its domain.

``RLTrainSpec.num_learning_epochs`` is the number of passes PPO's update makes
over each rollout batch, and it is consumed as a bare loop bound around the
whole optimizer step: ``for _ in range(spec.num_learning_epochs)`` encloses
every ``self.optimizer.step()`` in ``PpoTrainer.update``. So the field does not
merely scale how much optimization happens - a non-positive value removes all of
it, and nothing downstream notices.

Measured on this backend over a 60-step run before the gate existed: ``0`` and
``-3`` both reported ``status="success"``, took **zero** gradient steps, and
wrote a checkpoint whose parameters were bit-identical to each other, i.e. the
untrained initialisation. The reported losses read ``0.0`` rather than blank
because the update averages its accumulators through ``max(1, n_updates)``, so
an epoch count that ran no minibatch reports plausible metrics for a run that
learned nothing. ``True`` was a silent single epoch (12 optimizer steps instead
of 24), and ``2.7``/``nan``/``inf``/``"5"``/``None`` raised a bare ``TypeError``
out of ``range()`` after the environment, the networks and a full rollout had
been built.

Scoped to the on-policy backend: FastSAC optimizes per gradient step from a
replay buffer and has no epoch loop over a rollout batch, so it must not report
on a field it never reads. Every domain test here reaches the real ``validate``
entry point, so it covers the wiring as well as the domain.
