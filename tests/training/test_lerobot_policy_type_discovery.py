"""LeRobot policy-type validation is discovered from lerobot's live registry.

``LerobotTrainer.validate`` guards ``extra['policy_type']`` two ways: it rejects
types that are not LeRobot-native, and it rejects ``relative_actions`` for types
whose config lacks ``use_relative_actions``. Both gates used to consult
hardcoded sets that drifted behind lerobot: the native-type set listed only a
subset of the policies lerobot actually ships (so newer types such as ``eo1`` /
``molmoact2`` / ``vla_jepa`` / ``wall_x`` were wrongly reported "not
LeRobot-native"), and the relative-action set omitted ``groot`` (which exposes
``use_relative_actions``), so a valid ``groot`` + relative-actions run was
wrongly rejected. Both are now discovered live from lerobot's
``PreTrainedConfig`` ChoiceRegistry - the same zero-maintenance discovery the
reward-model, robot, teleop, and camera surfaces already use. The
``method='expert_only'`` gate is discovered the same way, off each config's
``train_expert_only`` field.

One gate is discovered slightly differently. The QUANTILES-normalization gate
reads each config's ``normalization_mapping`` *default* rather than a field
name, so it is the only probe here that can hold the type and still fail to
read its answer - and it resolves "unknown" and "declares no such field" two
deliberately different ways. ``TestQuantileNormRegistryProbe`` pins both.

These tests pin the invariant against whatever lerobot is installed (they read
its live registry rather than hardcoding type names), so they hold across
lerobot versions and fail on the pre-fix hardcoded gates whenever the registry
contains a type outside the stale sets.

Offline the static snapshots ARE the gates' answers, so ``TestOfflineFallback``
pins that each one is consulted and ``TestOfflineFallbackContent`` pins what is
in it: graded against the live registry by the DIRECTION it differs (see
:mod:`tests.training._lerobot_capability_range` - a snapshot naming a type the
registry has no such field on is always wrong, while a snapshot lagging a
lerobot newer than the declared floor is the drift a frozen snapshot cannot
avoid), and - with no lerobot needed - a subset of the native-type snapshot,
because a capability snapshot naming a type the native snapshot omits makes two
offline gates contradict each other about the same policy.
