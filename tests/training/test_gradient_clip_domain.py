"""The on-policy gradient-norm clip is checked against its domain.

``RLTrainSpec.max_grad_norm`` is the last thing that touches a gradient before
PPO steps: ``PpoTrainer.update`` ends every mini-batch with
``clip_grad_norm_(self.actor_critic.parameters(), spec.max_grad_norm)``. Nothing
judged the value, and ``clip_grad_norm_`` does not either - it multiplies every
gradient by ``max_norm / total_norm`` whenever that ratio is below one, and that
expression is defined for values no caller can have meant.

Measured on this backend before the gate existed, over a seeded 60-step run
whose checkpoint parameter sum starts at ``17.9251941755865118``:

* ``0`` and ``0.0`` reported ``status="success"`` and wrote a deployable
  checkpoint whose parameters were **bit-identical to a never-trained control** -
  the parameter delta was exactly ``0.0000000000``. Every gradient had been
  scaled to zero, so the optimizer stepped with no information.
* ``-1.0`` and ``-0.5`` also reported success, and moved the parameter sum to
  ``17.8211606460`` while the honored run moved it to ``17.9833114612`` - i.e.
  **away** from the objective. A negative bound negates the scaling ratio, so
  the same parameter whose gradient is ``[3.0, 4.0]`` comes out of
  ``clip_grad_norm_(-1.0)`` as ``[-0.6, -0.8]`` and the update becomes gradient
  *ascent* on the loss.
* ``True`` was a silent clip of one and ``"1.0"`` was silently accepted, because
  ``clip_grad_norm_`` coerces its bound through ``float()``.
* ``nan``, ``None`` and ``[1.0]`` raised from inside ``torch`` mid-update, after
  the environment, the networks and a full rollout had been built.

``inf`` is **inside** the domain: it is the field's only spelling of "do not
clip", and the consumer honors it by leaving every gradient untouched. That is
the reading which, had it belonged to zero, would have made this a contract
question rather than a defect - so the domain is a positive real, finite or
infinite, with no undecided endpoint.

The preflight is read-only, so it reports rather than raises for every value -
including a real no float64 stands for (``10**400``, ``Fraction(10**400, 3)``)
and a :class:`numbers.Real` registration with no working ``__float__``. Those
reach the shared domain, which answers each with a reason of its own.

Scoped to the on-policy backend: ``clip_grad_norm_`` appears in ``rl/ppo.py``
and nowhere else, so a backend that does not clip must not report on a field it
never reads. Every domain test here reaches the real ``validate`` entry point,
so it covers the wiring as well as the domain.

    ``numbers.Real`` is a registration rather than an inheritance, so a value

    one, the conversion's own exception escapes ``validate``.

    The exception is supplied per instance rather than fixed, because the
