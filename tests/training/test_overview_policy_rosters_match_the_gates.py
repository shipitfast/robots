"""Every policy-type roster ``docs/training/overview.md`` spells matches its gate.

The Training page's ``validate()`` paragraph tells a reader which policy types a
capability gate accepts - which types normalize with QUANTILES, and which expose
``use_relative_actions``. Those rosters are discovered from lerobot's live
registry at runtime (see
:func:`~strands_robots.training.lerobot._policy_supports_relative_actions` and
its siblings), so the page is a hand-written copy of an answer the code derives,
and a copy no test reads goes stale on the commit that widens the gate: the
relative-action roster was written as ``pi0``/``pi05``/``pi0_fast`` while the
gate had already accepted ``groot``, so the page denied a combination
``validate()`` accepted.

Pinned here: for each gate the page enumerates, the types it names are the types
the gate accepts, graded by the DIRECTION they differ (see
:mod:`tests.training._lerobot_capability_range`). A type the page names and the
gate refuses is always a failure - the page denies nothing and promises a
combination ``validate()`` rejects. A type the gate accepts and the page omits
is a failure once the installed lerobot is the floor the manifest declares; on a
newer in-range lerobot it is reported, because the manifest admits releases that
disagree about which policies carry a capability and no written roster can name
both sets. The rosters are read from the gates and the page, neither is spelled
in this file.
