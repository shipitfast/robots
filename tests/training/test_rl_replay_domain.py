"""The three counts a FastSAC replay loop is built from are checked against a domain.

``RLTrainSpec.buffer_size``, ``RLTrainSpec.batch_size`` and
``RLTrainSpec.gradient_steps`` are the three caller-supplied counts of an
off-policy SAC run's replay loop - the buffer's capacity, the transitions
sampled per gradient step, and the SAC updates run per iteration. Each is
consumed directly as a count: ``buffer_size`` is a tensor dimension built in
``FastSacTrainer.setup``, ``batch_size`` is passed to ``ReplayBuffer.sample``,
and ``gradient_steps`` is a ``range()`` bound in the update loop.

Because they are consumed as counts, a bare ``value <= 0`` test is weaker than
the strict-``int`` :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error` domain, and
both failure modes were measured on the MuJoCo reach env before this gate
existed (an otherwise-valid run, one field mutated): ``buffer_size=True`` built a
one-slot buffer that never reached ``learning_starts``, so **zero** gradient
updates ran, yet the run reported ``status="success"`` and "10 iterations x 4
steps complete"; ``buffer_size=0.5`` raised ``IndexError`` from
``ReplayBuffer.add`` (``int(0.5) == 0``, a zero-capacity buffer);
``batch_size=0.5`` / ``batch_size=True`` raised ``TypeError`` from
``torch.randint`` in ``ReplayBuffer.sample``; ``gradient_steps=0.5`` raised
``TypeError`` from ``range()`` in the update loop - each after the environment,
the networks, the optimizers and the replay buffer had been built - and ``"256"``
/ ``None`` raised ``TypeError`` out of the ``<= 0`` comparison itself, from a
``validate`` documented to *return* problems.

Only FastSAC reads these three fields. PPO sizes its minibatches from
``num_mini_batches`` and never reads them, so it must stay quiet about them, as
must every supervised backend; :class:`TestABackendThatDoesNotReadThemStaysQuiet`
pins that. ``learning_starts`` and ``tau`` are outside this gate's field set, and
:class:`TestTauAndLearningStartsAreNotInThisDomain` pins that scope line rather
than leaving it to prose. ``tau`` is a coefficient in ``(0, 1]`` and so shares no
part of this domain; it has its own gate on its own interval, graded in
``tests/training/test_polyak_coefficient_domain.py``. ``learning_starts`` is one side of a relation
(``>= batch_size``) and *does* share the domain: FastSAC asks it of the same
strict-``int`` rule as the relation's other operand, in its own ``validate``
rather than through this gate, because PPO reads neither field. That is graded in
``tests/training/test_learning_starts_count_domain.py``, which measured the cost
of leaving it to the relation alone - a non-finite value compares False against
every ``int``, so the relation passed and the run took zero gradient steps while
reporting success, the same outcome ``buffer_size=True`` produces above.

Every domain test here reaches the real ``validate`` entry point, so it covers
the wiring as well as the domain.
