"""Every field-scoped shared-domain guard sees a table-driven read of its field.

Each shared numeric domain on :class:`~strands_robots.training.base.Trainer`
documents a biconditional - a backend that reads the field MUST route it
through the gate, one that ignores it MUST NOT report on it - and the guard for
each domain pins the first half with a scope *derived from the tree*, so that
"a new backend that starts reading the field fails this test until it does".

That promise rests entirely on the guard's notion of "reads the field". A
backend can read a spec field two ways: by name (``spec.seed``) or through a
forwarding table (``getattr(spec, field)`` over a tuple of field names, which
is how a transport-only provider serializes every field it passes on). A scan
keyed on the first form alone certifies a complete sweep while a table-driven
reader sits outside it, and the biconditional is then unenforced for exactly
that backend - silently, because the guard reports a clean tree.

This grades the guards from the outside rather than trusting each to grade
itself: the set of field-scoped guards is discovered structurally, so a new
domain guard is held to the same rule the moment it lands.

That promise is only as wide as the discovery, and a discovery keyed on the
*name* of a helper is not a structural one. The guards spell the helper that
lists the backend modules two ways - ``_trainer_modules`` and
``_training_modules`` - so a rule keyed on either spelling grades the guards
that use it and reports a clean sweep over the rest.
:func:`is_field_scoped_guard` keys on the two properties that make a guard
gradeable instead (it consults the one shared read rule, and its scope is rooted
at the backend tree), and is the one rule both the sweep over the real tree and
the constructed exemplars in :class:`TestTheDiscoveryDoesNotDependOnAHelperName`
consult.

"Consults the shared rule" is itself the second thing that was once a name. A
guard may wrap :func:`~tests.training._spec_field_reads.reads_spec_field` in a
local ``_reads...`` helper, or call it directly - the latter has no wrapper to
drift out of step and is the better shape - and a discovery that required the
wrapper dropped the guard that chose the second form. That is the same hole one
identifier wide as the one above, so both forms qualify, and
:func:`_reader_helper` resolves the shared rule itself when there is no wrapper.
