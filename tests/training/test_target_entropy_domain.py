"""FastSAC's entropy temperature is checked where it is aimed, not only where it starts.

``target_entropy`` is the third and last caller-supplied field of FastSAC's
temperature block, and the only one nothing judged. It is the constant the
temperature is optimized *toward* - the one term of the temperature loss a caller
supplies::

    alpha_loss = -(self.log_alpha * (logp + self.target_entropy).detach()).mean()

reaching that expression through an unconditional ``float(spec.target_entropy)``
coercion in ``setup``. Its two neighbours - the temperature's starting value and
the rate that moves it - were both put behind a positive-finite domain, and this
field was explicitly left out of both because it is *signed* by construction: it
defaults to ``-num_actions``, so a positive-finite domain would refuse every
reading of it. The domain it does take is the signed counterpart the on-policy
loss weights already read, ``finite_number_error``: any finite real, either sign,
because no endpoint of a target entropy in nats is decidable while a value that is
not a finite real has no reading at all.

Measured on a 40-timestep run, ``validate()`` returning ``[]`` for all of them.
``True`` is a silent sign flip - a target entropy of ``+1.0`` where the field's own
default is ``-6.0`` for this env - and the run reported success while checkpointing
``log_alpha == -0.0018031001091003418`` against the honored run's
``-0.001801646314561367``, so it drove the temperature somewhere else rather than
harmlessly. ``nan`` / ``inf`` / ``-inf`` poison ``alpha``, which scales the entropy
term of both the critic's TD target and the actor loss, and the next rollout raises
``ValueError`` from inside ``torch.distributions.Normal`` about a tensor of ``nan``
policy means - naming that distribution's parameter rather than the field, after
the env, both networks and a full rollout have been built. A list or a dict raises
``TypeError`` out of the ``float()`` coercion in ``setup``.

Two scoping decisions are pinned as well as the domain. ``None`` is exempt rather
than refused: the field is annotated ``float | None`` and ``None`` is the
documented request for the ``-num_actions`` heuristic, unlike the two neighbours
whose ``float`` annotations carry concrete defaults. And the check is *not*
conditioned on ``autotune_alpha`` even though only the tuning branch spends the
value, because the coercion that reads it is unconditional - with tuning off a list
raises the same ``TypeError`` while ``nan`` reaches a successful run that never
spends it, so a check scoped to the tuning branch would let the raising shape
through for the untuned one.

Every test reaches the real ``validate`` entry point, so the wiring is covered as
well as the domain.
