"""A session that stops before every collected test ran says how much never ran.

``.github/workflows/test-lint.yml`` runs the required check under ``-x``, so the
suite can abort at the first failure with a quarter of its items unexecuted. The
counts line pytest then prints (``1 failed, 34268 passed, 278 skipped``) is
shaped exactly like a complete run's, and the abort banner names the stop
without sizing it - so a reader cannot tell a total from a floor. These cells
pin the statement that distinguishes them, and pin that it stays absent when the
session did run everything it collected.

Each end-to-end cell runs both in one process and across ``pytest-xdist``
workers, because the two sessions count their extent through different hooks: a
distributed controller never collects, so it has no ``session.items`` to size
itself by and the statement has to come from what the workers collected.
