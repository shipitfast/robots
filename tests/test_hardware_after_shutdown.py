"""A rollout can neither start nor finish successfully on a shut-down robot.

``_shutdown_event`` is one of the control loop's exit conditions::

    while (
        time.monotonic() - start_mono < duration
        and (n_steps is None or self._task_state.step_count < n_steps)
        and self._task_state.status == TaskStatus.RUNNING
        and not self._stop_requested.is_set()
        and not self._shutdown_event.is_set()   # <- set by cleanup()
    ):

but it was neither an admission check nor a terminal-status discriminator, so
once ``cleanup()`` had set it a rollout ran the whole bring-up, fell out of the
loop on the condition's first evaluation, and reported itself ``completed``.

Two producers reach that state, and they need different fixes - which is why
both are pinned here:

**A task started after ``cleanup()``.** Bring-up is not side-effect-free, so
this is refused at the entry points rather than merely relabelled. Measured on
a two-device arm, calling each entry point once after ``cleanup()``:

    entry point                    verdict on main       connect()  left open
    run_policy                     success                   1        True
    execute (agent tool / mesh)     success                   1        True
    start_task                     raises RuntimeError        0        False

- ``_connect_robot()`` re-opens the motors bus and warms every camera. Because
  ``cleanup()`` does not disconnect the robot and the executor is already shut
  down, those devices stay open for the life of the process - a second
  ``cleanup()`` does not close them either.
- ``Policy.reset()`` is called, clearing the per-episode state of a policy
  object the caller may still be driving (the documented ``policy_object=``
  reuse pattern).
- The policy is never queried and the arm is never commanded, yet two of the
  three entry points returned ``status="success"`` with ``steps: 0`` - a result
  indistinguishable from a rollout that really drove the arm.
- ``start_task`` was the odd one out: it raised
  ``RuntimeError("cannot schedule new futures after shutdown")`` from the
  executor submit, naming a ``concurrent.futures`` internal rather than the
  robot, against this module's contract that a handler returns an error dict.

**A ``cleanup()`` landing during bring-up.** No entry-point guard can cover
this one: ``cleanup()`` sets ``_shutdown_event`` and only then calls
``stop_task()``, gated on ``status == RUNNING``. A task still in ``CONNECTING``
therefore gets no stop latch, finishes bring-up, and exits the loop on its
first evaluation::

    status when cleanup() ran : connecting
    _stop_requested set       : False        <- stop_task() never called
    verdict on main           : success
    task status / steps       : completed / 0

so the terminal block has to treat ``_shutdown_event`` the way it already
treats the stop latch. That fixes what the rollout *reports*. It does not stop
the bring-up: an entry-point guard cannot cover this producer, but the
in-flight stage gate can, and it read only the stop latch. With the status
already correct, the same side effects listed above still ran after the
teardown was latched::

    Policy.reset() on the caller's object : 1   <- 0 for the other producer
    observation reads off bus + cameras   : 1
    policy-server dial / checkpoint load  : 1

Both producers now stop before the next effect, which is why the two are
asserted side by side here.

No serial port is opened and no arm is commanded: an in-memory double stands in
for the driver, and the bring-up window is opened by the test rather than slept
through, so every assertion here is deterministic.
