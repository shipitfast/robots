"""``start`` / ``status`` / ``stop`` on the real robot carry the instruction-not-read notice.

The ``execute`` envelope gained the sentence; the background lifecycle did not.
Measured with an agent: ``start`` "trace a small circle" with ``mock`` →
``Task started: 'trace a small circle'``, ``status`` → ``RUNNING … Steps: 18``,
``stop`` → ``Task stopped … Steps completed: 34``, and the agent summarised
"Task launched successfully … RUNNING - 18 steps completed … stopped cleanly".
Nothing in three answers said the circle was never attempted.
