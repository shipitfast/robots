"""The declared huggingface_hub floor must actually ship the bucket CLI.

``sync_dataset_to_bucket`` runs two subcommands of the ``hf`` CLI:
``hf buckets create`` and ``hf sync``. Both first ship in **huggingface_hub
1.5.0**, as ``huggingface_hub/cli/buckets.py`` registered by ``cli/hf.py``.
Every earlier release installs an ``hf`` entry point without that module and
answers either invocation with ``Error: No such command 'buckets'`` / ``'sync'``.

The library's version gate, its upgrade instructions and the ``[wbc]`` extra's
pin all previously named ``>=1.0``, which is two-and-a-half minor releases below
the capability. That made three claims wrong at once:

* a caller on 1.0-1.4.x passed the gate, so the gate that exists to replace CLI
  usage noise with an upgrade instruction stayed silent for exactly the releases
  it describes;
* the upgrade instruction the library printed - ``pip install -U
  'huggingface_hub>=1.0'`` - could be followed to the letter and still resolve a
  CLI that cannot run a bucket sync; and
* the ``[wbc]`` pin let a fresh resolve land on such a CLI while satisfying the
  documented minimum.

Every assertion below reads the floor from
``dataset_recorder._HF_BUCKET_CLI_MIN_VERSION`` rather than restating it, so the
gate, the messages, the docs and the packaging pin cannot drift apart again.
