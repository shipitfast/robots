"""Reading a streamed dataset in capture order is ``buffer_size=1``, not ``shuffle=False``.

``StreamingDatasetReader.open`` forwards ``shuffle`` to lerobot's
``StreamingLeRobotDataset``, where it decides only WHICH generator drives the
reordering: ``np.random.default_rng(seed)``, reseeded identically on every
exhaustion, or the dataset's own advancing one. lerobot documents it as
"whether to shuffle the dataset across exhaustions", and its ``__iter__``
reorders either way, at two levels - a shard sampled at random per frame, then a
reservoir buffer of ``buffer_size`` yielded from at a random index.

Two of the recipes a caller reads first - the ``StreamingDatasetReader`` class
docstring's "in-process eval / replay" Example and the streaming section of
``docs/data/reading-back.md`` - passed ``shuffle=False`` alone and commented it
"chronological for replay/eval". It is not: on a 60-frame recorded dataset that
recipe yields frame indices ``28, 55, 18, 24, 7, ...``, and passing
``shuffle=True`` alongside ``buffer_size=1`` reads in capture order anyway. So
the flag named for shuffling does not decide order, nothing reports a shuffled
read, and an eval or replay loop that followed the documented recipe consumed
its episode out of order while its own comment said otherwise.

The cells below pin both halves: the ordering contract, against a double shaped
like lerobot's iterator rather than like this module's description of it, and the
documented recipes, so a surface that claims capture order names the knob that
delivers it.

    dependency's shape rather than this module's account of it:

    * ``shuffle`` selects the generator only - a fresh
      ``default_rng(seed)`` when False (identical on every exhaustion) versus an
      advancing one when True. Neither switches the reordering off.
    * shards are sampled at random per frame from

      interleaves.

      random index, and whatever is left is shuffled once the shards are
      exhausted.

    ``hf_shards`` is a class attribute because the caller cannot reach it: the
