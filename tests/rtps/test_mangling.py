"""Unit tests for ROS 2 <-> DDS name mangling (pure string transforms).

Beyond the happy-path transforms, these pin one property: every name this module
returns is a name it would itself accept, and a ROS 2 name it cannot map is
refused rather than mangled into something plausible.

Two edges settle that. ``dds_type_name`` maps *message* interfaces only - ROS 2
generates one DDS type per constituent message of a service or an action, so
there is no single type to return for one, and an invented
``pkg::srv::dds_::Name_`` is what the participant would then advertise in DDS
discovery for a struct ROS 2 never generates. ``ros_topic_name`` checks the name
it recovers against the same rule ``dds_topic_name`` applies, because a DDS graph
carries topics no ROS 2 node published, so stripping the prefix alone does not
yield a ROS 2 name.
