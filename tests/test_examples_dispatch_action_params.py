"""Examples must not pass a parameter the dispatch router refuses.

``sim._dispatch_action(action, params)`` reports an unknown parameter by
RETURNING ``{"status": "error", ...}`` rather than raising, so an example that
discards the result silently no-ops. The observed defect (#244): a sim VLA
example passed ``camera_name`` to ``add_camera``, whose parameter is ``name``.
``camera_name`` is the render-side spelling (``render`` / ``render_depth`` /
``get_frame`` / ``get_camera_params`` / ``get_world_point``), so the mistake
reads plausible -- and because the envelope was dropped the world kept only its
default camera and the policy failed much later complaining about missing image
keys, pointing at the policy instead of the refused call. The router has since
accepted that spelling on ``add_camera`` / ``remove_camera``
(``MuJoCoSimEngine._camera_name_alias_target``), so the same key is now
accepted there and still refused on ``get_observation``, which is why the
planted-offender pin below uses the latter.

This statically scans every example for ``_dispatch_action`` calls written with
a literal action name and a literal parameter dict, and checks each parameter
name against the router's own acceptance rule. The accepted set is DERIVED from
the live engine class (its ``_ACTION_ALIASES`` / ``_FIELD_ALIASES`` /
``_ROUTER_PASSTHROUGH`` plus ``inspect.signature``) rather than hand-listed, so
the guard tracks the router instead of drifting from it.
