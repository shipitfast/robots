"""Contract pins for the changelog fragment check.

``scripts/check_changelog_fragment.py`` exists because the one rule the changelog
convention rests on had no gate behind it. ``changelog.d/README.md`` and
``AGENTS.md`` both say a behavioural change records itself as a
``changelog.d/<number>-<slug>.md`` fragment and never appends to
``## [Unreleased]``; sixty-seven fragments follow it; and with three entries
inserted directly beneath that heading, ``assemble_changelog.py --check`` exits 0
and the 30 tests in ``tests/test_changelog_format.py`` +
``tests/test_changelog_fragments.py`` all pass. Neither suite can see a fragment
that was never written, because a missing file leaves nothing to inspect.

The checks below pin the four properties that make the script worth having:

- it **refuses** a direct append, replayed as real commits in a real repository
  rather than as a hand-built string pair;
- it is **self-clearing** -- moving the entry into a fragment makes it pass, so
  the remedy it asks for is the remedy that satisfies it, with no override;
- it **does not obstruct a release**: the assembler renders a fragment verbatim
  and deletes what it consumed, so an assemble run's entries are accounted for
  per entry -- and a release that *also* hand-writes one is still refused, for
  only that one;
- it is **quiet** where nothing was added: editing, rewording, or reordering an
  entry already in the log, and the 168 legacy entries on ``main``, are not
  additions.

The git-topology tests are the load-bearing ones. The question is what a branch
*added*, which is a statement about a merge base, and a merge base is exactly the
thing a hand-built fixture would assume rather than exercise.

# change correctly adds no heading to the log, so the added-entry set is empty and
# the check is silent. Fragment validity was enforced only by
