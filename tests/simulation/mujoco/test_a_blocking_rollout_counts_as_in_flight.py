"""A blocking rollout is in flight, and every reader of that population says so.

Two entry points launch a rollout on this engine. ``start_policy`` submits it to
the executor and registers a Future; the blocking ``run_policy`` drives it on the
caller's own thread and registers nothing. ``_active_policy_robots`` -- the
population every "what is running" surface reads -- answered from the Future
table alone, so for as long as a blocking rollout drove the arm it was invisible:

* ``list_policies_running`` answered "No policies running.",
* the mesh ``status`` command answered ``idle`` with an empty ``robots_running``,
  and its state topic published ``active=False``, and
* the ``{"action": "stop"}`` fanout ``Mesh.emergency_stop`` broadcasts answered
  ``{"ok": True, "stopped": [], "note": "no policies running"}`` and halted
  NOTHING. :func:`~strands_robots.mesh.core._peers_that_did_not_stop` reads a
  top-level ``ok`` as a peer that stopped, so the operator was told the fleet had
  halted while the rollout kept driving the arm for the rest of its duration --
  measured at 8 of 10 seconds. That is the affirmative lie the surrounding stop
  branches are commented against, reached through the population rather than
  through the verdict.

``stop_policy`` was the only surface that also read the per-robot
``policy_running`` claim, so it and ``list_policies_running`` reported opposite
facts about the same instant ("Stopped on 'arm'" with ``was_running=True``
against "No policies running.") -- the two-sources drift #2833 is about, and the
thing ``docs/simulation/rollouts.md`` promised could not happen.

Pinned here: both launch shapes put the robot in the population, every reader
inherits that from the one verb that owns it, the fleet stop actually halts a
blocking rollout, and -- the half that keeps the widening from being over-broad
-- an idle world is still reported idle by all of them.

The blocking shape is set up through ``_announce_rollout``, the launcher seam the
blocking ``run_policy`` itself calls, so these read the state a real rollout
produces without racing one. The fleet-stop cells drive a genuine rollout,
because "it was really halted" is not a claim a flag can make.
