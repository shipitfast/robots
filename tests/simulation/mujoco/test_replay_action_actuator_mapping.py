"""Regression: positional action-vector binding uses actuators, not joints.

A ``LeRobotDataset``'s ``action`` column is written in the robot's *actuator*
order (``SimEngine.robot_action_keys``); see the recorder in
``strands_robots/simulation/mujoco/recording.py``, which deliberately keys the
action schema by actuators because keying by joint names "records all-zero
action columns" for robots whose actuators differ from their joints.

On replay the recorded vector must be mapped back onto the SAME actuator keys.
Mapping it onto ``robot_joint_names`` instead (the pre-fix behaviour) mis-maps
and silently drops commanded DOFs on any robot whose actuator set differs from
its joint set - passive/mimic finger joints or a tendon-driven gripper - while
``replay_episode`` still reports ``status="success"``: a silent record->replay
round-trip corruption. The same convention governs ``send_action`` when given a
raw numeric action vector (``SimEngine._coerce_action``).

``aloha`` is the decisive case: 14 actuators (per-arm 6 joints + 1 gripper
tendon) vs 16 joints (each arm adds 2 passive finger joints with no driving
actuator). A 14-long action vector recorded in actuator order was previously
mapped onto the 16-joint list, shifting the entire right arm by one index and
dropping both grippers.
