"""A latched external wrench belongs to the body it was applied to.

``apply_force`` latches a wrench that MuJoCo re-applies on every subsequent
step. These tests pin who that latch belongs to: applying a wrench to one body
must not revoke a wrench already latched on another, a second call on the same
body must replace rather than accumulate onto it, and the latch must keep
describing the world-frame wrench the caller asked for as the body moves.

Pre-fix the wrench went into ``qfrc_applied``, one world-wide generalized-force
vector that every call zeroed in full, so a second ``apply_force`` on a
different body silently cancelled the first while both calls reported success.
