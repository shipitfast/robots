"""A camera recorder is registered before the thread that fills it exists.

``_cams_rec_state`` is the only route every other recorder verb has to a live
recording: ``get_cameras_recording_status`` reads it to name a phase,
``stop_cameras_recording`` reads it to find the buffers to flush, and both start
verbs read it to refuse replacing a recording that still holds frames. So the
order in which :meth:`start_cameras_recording` starts its capture thread and
publishes that registration is a contract, not an implementation detail:
publishing second leaves a window in which a thread is already rendering into
buffers that nothing can reach.

Every consequence pinned here was measured in that window - a status read
answering ``[idle]`` about a live capture, a stop returning ``status="success"``
with "Was not recording cameras" while that thread kept filling its buffers to
the ``max_frames`` cap, and a second start admitted onto the same cameras whose
own registration was then overwritten, orphaning its thread and its frames.
That last one is the outcome the start guard exists to prevent, so the window
also disabled the guard.

The window is a few bytecodes wide, so it is not reachable by sleeping. It is
entered deterministically here instead: the recorder's ``Thread`` class is
replaced by a subclass that runs a hook on the *calling* thread as the recorder
thread is constructed, which is exactly the moment the recording must already
be registered. The threads are real and ``render`` is faked, so the buffers,
the guard and the flush all run without a GL context.

Each cell starts its recording in a statement and asserts on the result
afterwards. The start is what enters the window, so it must not sit inside an
``assert``, which the compiler is free to discard - with ``-O`` the whole
statement becomes two instructions and no call, and the cell reports a pass
having never recorded anything. Only the read-only checks belong in the
assertions.
