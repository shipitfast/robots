"""add_robot surfaces an actionable error for an unknown/unresolvable model.

Contract: when a caller names a robot that resolves to no model (a mistyped
registry key, or an instance label given without a model source), the engine
returns the same actionable "no model found (did you mean ...?) / list_urdfs /
pass data_config= or urdf_path=" error that the ``data_config`` exit and the
top-level ``Robot()`` factory give - not a dead-end "Either urdf_path or
data_config is required" that never names the robot nor points at discovery.

The bare "supply a model source" message is preserved for the genuine no-name
case (``add_robot()`` with nothing to resolve), and the deprecated positional
name-as-registry-key short form still resolves a VALID name.

A model source that is SUPPLIED but empty is a fourth condition, and it is not
the "given without a model source" one above: read by truthiness the two were
indistinguishable, so ``urdf_path=""`` fell through to the name lookup and got
byte-identically what passing no source returns - a name diagnosis, close-match
suggestions for a name the caller never asked to resolve, and advice to pass the
kwarg they had just passed. It is refused naming that parameter instead, the way
``register_urdf`` already refuses an empty ``urdf_path``. Whitespace stays a
path ("File not found"), which is the boundary.
