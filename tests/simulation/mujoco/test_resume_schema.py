"""Unit tests for ``RecordingMixin._verify_resume_schema``.

The schema-verification helper is a pure function of its arguments (it reads no
instance state), so these tests bind it to a dummy ``self`` and run without
mujoco or lerobot installed. They pin the #366 follow-up: resume() must reject a
scene whose schema diverges from the existing on-disk dataset rather than
deferring to a cryptic per-feature shape error on the next add_frame.

The dataset frame rate is part of that schema: a resume cannot change it, so a
differing ``fps`` must be refused rather than silently appending frames on the
dataset's timebase instead of the requested one.
