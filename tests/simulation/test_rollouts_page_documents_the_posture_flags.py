"""``docs/simulation/rollouts.md`` documents the posture-flag domain the facades enforce.

The page documents every numeric domain ``SimEngine.run_policy`` and
``SimEngine.eval_policy`` hold their knobs to - ``n_steps``, ``duration``,
``action_horizon``, ``n_episodes``, ``max_steps`` - each in a paragraph that
names the knob, the refusal and where it sits. The posture flags in the same
signatures (``fast_mode``, ``reset_between``, ``wbc_install_torque_control``,
``async_rtc``) gained their domain through ``SimEngine._validate_posture_flags``
with no paragraph beside those, so a reader of the page saw the numeric knobs
checked and had to infer the flags were not.

Pinned here: the paragraph exists and names every boolean parameter of both
facades, so a fifth flag bound to the domain cannot leave the page describing
four; and the paragraph's claim about *where* the check sits stays true - the
facades check and ``PolicyRunner.run`` does not repeat it - so a later decision
to check on the runner has to move this sentence rather than leave it stale.
The roster is read from the signatures, not spelled here.
