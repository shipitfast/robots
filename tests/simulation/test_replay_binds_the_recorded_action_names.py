"""Replay binds a recorded action column by the names the recording wrote for it.

``PolicyRunner.replay`` maps the recorded ``action`` vector onto action keys by
index. Before this change the keys were whatever ``robot_action_keys`` returned
*today*, and the recorder writes that same list into the dataset as
``features["action"]["names"]`` at *record* time. Those two agree only while
the backend's key order is fixed. #3851 moved the MuJoCo order from actuator
declaration to joint order on eleven robots, and the width guard cannot see the
difference: a ``dynamixel_2r`` episode recorded as ``[R2, R1]`` replayed under
the new ``[R1, R2]`` with every value on the other actuator and
``status="success"``, the same failure the reorder fixed on the state side.

The recording already carries the answer, so replay reads it: when the dataset
names its action columns and those names are this robot's actuators in any
order, the vector is bound by name. ``send_action`` resolves a dict by name, so
the recorded order is the right order whatever the backend says now. A dataset
without that schema (the column-only fakes below) or one whose columns are
another roster keeps the positional path, since neither is an ordering
question and ``action_key_map`` is the explicit answer there.
