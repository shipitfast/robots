"""Regression tests for the ``base_yaw_beyond`` floating-base heading predicate.

The predicate/reward DSL grew FORWARD- and LATERAL-progress success predicates
(``base_beyond_x`` / ``base_beyond_y``) alongside the velocity-tracking reward
(``base_velocity_tracking``, which already accepts a yaw-rate ``wz`` command) and
the fall predicates (``base_tipped`` / ``base_below_z``). The YAW success half -
"the base actually turned" - was still inexpressible: ``base_beyond_x`` /
``base_beyond_y`` read only ``base_pos``, so a turn-in-place benchmark could
reward a ``wz`` command but had no way to SCORE reaching a heading goal, and
``base_tipped`` fires on ANY tilt (roll/pitch), not a deliberate turn about the
vertical.

``base_yaw_beyond(yaw, robot)`` closes that gap: TRUE when the base's world yaw
heading (extracted from ``base_quat``) has passed ``yaw`` radians (positive is a
left / counter-clockwise turn from the identity spawn). These tests set a KNOWN
base pose directly on the sim and assert the threshold, that it reads the YAW
axis (a pure roll/pitch does NOT trip it, distinguishing it from ``base_tipped``),
position/height independence, that x-position does NOT trip it (distinct from
``base_beyond_x``), live tracking, fixed-base degradation, that a goal outside the
range a heading can be measured in is refused at registration rather than scoring
every rollout the same way, and that a real ``DeclarativeBenchmark`` whose success
is ``base_yaw_beyond`` and failure is ``base_tipped`` + ``base_below_z`` succeeds
once the base turns and is vetoed if it falls. They are GL-free (``get_observation`` with ``skip_images``) so they run
in CI without a display.
