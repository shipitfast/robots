"""A scene whose cameras do not have distinct dataset column names is refused.

A LeRobot feature name cannot contain ``/``, so a camera's namespace separator
is recorded as ``__`` (:func:`strands_robots.utils.camera_schema_key`). That
mapping is not injective: ``arm/wrist`` and ``arm__wrist`` are two cameras in
the scene and one ``observation.images.arm__wrist`` column in the dataset.

Nothing downstream could tell which camera the column was declared for, and the
three ways of asking each failed differently: recording every camera was refused
far from the cause (as a repeated ``camera_keys`` entry, which reads as the
caller naming one camera twice); ``cameras=`` naming both reported success and
dropped one, leaving the column carrying the other camera's frames; and
``cameras=`` naming one succeeded with the column's contents decided by which
spelling was used. Every one of those happened after ``overwrite=True`` had
already wiped the dataset being replaced.

Covers:

* every one of the three ways of asking is refused, with a message naming both
  cameras and the key they share;
* the refusal happens before any dataset is created, resumed or wiped;
* a scene whose camera names stay distinct after the collapse still records end
  to end (the control), including a namespaced robot camera on its own;
* ``camera_schema_key`` is idempotent and is the single owner of the collapse;
* every backend that declares a dataset schema consults the guard.
