"""An Isaac camera recording is encoded whole, or it stays there to be encoded.

``IsaacSimulation.stop_cameras_recording`` hands each camera's buffer to
:func:`strands_robots.rendering.encode_clip`, whose encoder is two dependencies -
``imageio`` and the MP4 plugin ``imageio`` itself leaves optional - so the probe
can refuse before any writer is opened. Nothing is encoded and nothing is
touched, and the refusal quotes the encoder's own remedy: install it and call the
verb again.

That remedy is only followable while the frames are still reachable, and the
flush had already dropped ``_cams_rec_state`` before reading a single buffer. So
the refusal destroyed exactly what it said was recoverable: every camera's frames
went with the registration, a second call answered "Was not recording cameras."
about them, and a new ``start`` replaced the attribute under ``status="success"``.

The MuJoCo recorder decided this already - only a flush that encoded deregisters
(``_flush_and_deregister_cameras_recording``) - and words it in the shared
:func:`~strands_robots.simulation.recording.encoder_absent_flush_refusal`. These
cells pin the same three answers for Isaac: what the refusal reports, that a
later call encodes the frames it kept, and that a start cannot discard them.

The engine is a skeleton ``IsaacSimulation`` built with ``__new__`` (the fixture
shape ``test_cameras_recording_preflight_guards.py`` uses) so the recording
lifecycle runs without the Isaac Sim Kit runtime.
