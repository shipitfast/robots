"""A second ``start_recording`` while one is live is refused; the live one is untouched.

It used to fall through: the recorder object was replaced (the frames buffered
since the last ``save_episode`` went with it - never saved, never mentioned), and
when the new dataset then refused (schema mismatch on resume) the caller was left
with ``recording`` False and both sessions' frames gone. Observed on the tool
surface as ``start_recording lab/live -> run_policy (15 steps) -> start_recording
lab/other -> success ... [recording] 0 steps captured``.

The refusal belongs to all THREE backends that implement ``start_recording``
(MuJoCo, Isaac, Newton) - each arms the shared recorder the same way, so each
drops frames the same way - and both figures it quotes are scoped to the live
SESSION, since what the caller is deciding is what THIS session would lose.
