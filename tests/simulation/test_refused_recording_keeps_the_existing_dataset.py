"""A refused ``start_recording`` leaves the caller's dataset where it was.

``overwrite=True`` is the one posture that deletes a real LeRobotDataset without
asking (:meth:`~strands_robots.simulation.recording.DatasetRecordingMixin._prepare_dataset_target`),
and it is what the ``run_policy`` agent tool records with. Every camera-shaped
refusal ``start_recording`` makes was already ahead of that deletion - the
``cameras=`` name-list domain, the boolean postures, the fps domain, and the
scene-level key collision, whose own guard is documented as running "before any
dataset is created, resumed or wiped". One was not: a single unknown name in
``cameras=`` was refused from inside the schema-declaration block, roughly a
hundred lines after the wipe, so the call reported an error having already
removed the dataset it was replacing - and the refusal's remedy ("Add them with
``add_camera(...)`` ... or omit ``cameras=``") asks for a retry against the data
that same call destroyed.

Nothing between resolving the target and building the recorder reads or writes
the dataset directory - the schema is read from the scene - so the deletion is
deferred to the last statement before the recorder is built, which puts every
refusal ahead of it.

Covers:

* an existing dataset survives a refused ``cameras=`` call, byte for byte, and
  still reopens through ``LeRobotDataset`` with its frames and image column;
* the refusal itself is unchanged - same status, same message, no session left
  open (the invariant refusing earlier must not break);
* no refusal sits between the deletion and the recorder in any backend that
  ships a ``start_recording``, derived from the tree so a backend or a refusal
  added later is graded on arrival;
* ``overwrite=True`` still replaces an existing dataset and a non-dataset
  directory is still not clobbered - the deletion is deferred, not dropped.
