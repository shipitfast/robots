"""``get_recording_status`` reports the dataset that was saved, not a cleared buffer.

Measured on ``Robot("so101", mode="sim")``: ``start_recording(repo_id="lab/so101_ep",
root=/tmp/x)`` -> 30 scripted steps -> ``stop_recording`` answered "37 frames, 1
episode(s)", and ``get_recording_status`` right after it answered ``[idle] Not
recording (last episode: 0 steps)`` - byte-identical to the sentence a sim that
has never recorded gives. It read ``state["trajectory"]``, the mirror
``_release_dataset_recorder`` had just cleared, so the count was structurally
zero after every successful save.

Two readers were pointed here. ``docs/simulation/overview.md`` advertises
"Episode, frame count, output dir" for this method, and
``docs/troubleshooting.md`` sends an operator here to "check
get_recording_status() frame count" when an MP4 is empty - so the zero was the
false confirmation of the very diagnosis ("stopped before any frames") the
operator was sent to rule out.

``stop_recording`` now stashes the four facts of the save it just made, past the
teardown that drops the recorder, and idle reports them with a replay call. That
recipe carries ``root=`` because the bare id is not always enough: a later
session that saves nothing still moves ``last_dataset_repo_id`` /
``last_dataset_root`` (what #3786's replay adoption reads), and a bare-id replay
of the older id then errors while ``root=`` succeeds.
