"""An undriven robot's declared ``observation.state`` columns are measurements.

``start_recording`` declares ``observation.state`` over every robot in the
scene, prefixing each column with its robot's name. A single-policy rollout's
recording hook supplies only the driven robot's observation, so before this was
fixed every column belonging to another robot fell through to
``DatasetRecorder.add_frame``'s ``0.0`` fill - recorded in the same column, with
the same dtype, as a measurement, for every frame, under ``status="success"``.

Nothing downstream can tell that zero from a real reading: a policy trained on
the dataset learns the other robot is permanently at its zero pose. The
disagreement is unbounded, because an undriven robot keeps whatever pose it was
placed in.

The *action* half of the same frame is a separate question and deliberately not
touched here - no command was issued to a robot this rollout does not drive, so
there is no truthful value to write (#1715). A state column has one: the robot
is in the scene and its joint positions are readable at that instant.

Every recording entry point declares the schema over the whole scene and then
supplies a frame covering only the robots it drives, so each one needs the same
fill. That is the three single-policy hooks, whose frame carries one robot, and
``run_multi_policy``'s synchronized loop, whose merged frame carries the keys of
its ``policies`` mapping - a mapping the contract requires to name robots in the
scene, but never requires to name all of them. A synchronized call that drives a
subset of the scene therefore leaves the rest to the fill exactly as a
single-policy hook does.
