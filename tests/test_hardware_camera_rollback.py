"""A failed connect must not leave a camera it already opened streaming.

``strands_robots.hardware_robot.Robot._close_open_devices`` exists so a
connect that fails partway can be retried. lerobot's robots open their devices
in sequence -- ``bus.connect()``, then ``for cam in self.cameras.values():
cam.connect()`` -- and neither the loop nor the failing camera closes the
cameras opened before it. Rolling back only the serial port therefore leaves
the camera set half-open, and that is not merely untidy: it makes the next
attempt unrecoverable.

lerobot gates both recovery paths on ``is_connected``, which is
``bus.is_connected and all(cam.is_connected ...)``:

    - ``Robot.connect()`` is ``@check_if_already_connected``, so the retry
      raises ``DeviceAlreadyConnectedError`` on the camera that is *healthy*,
      masking the camera that actually failed;
    - ``Robot.disconnect()`` is ``@check_if_not_connected``, so it refuses to
      run while any one camera is still shut.

These tests pin that the rollback closes every device it can, so the retry
keeps surfacing the real failure:

    - a camera opened before the failing one is closed;
    - the retry still reports the camera that actually failed, instead of
      degrading into a generic "Failed to connect" that names nothing;
    - a camera that never opened is left alone (it released its own resources
      in ``connect()``, and disconnecting it again would raise);
    - the cameras are closed independently, so one stuck camera cannot keep the
      rest of the set open -- the failure mode lerobot's own ``disconnect()``
      has;
    - a close that raises never masks the original connect error;
    - both call sites roll the cameras back: the explicit ``_connect_robot``
      and the lazy connect inside ``send_action``.

No camera device and no serial port is opened: the lerobot driver and its
cameras are in-memory fakes that mirror lerobot's connect ordering and its
``is_connected`` / decorator contracts.
