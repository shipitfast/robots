"""The declared lerobot floor must actually guarantee bucket streaming.

``stream_dataset(repo_type="bucket")`` needs a ``StreamingLeRobotDataset`` that
accepts a ``repo_type`` parameter. lerobot 0.6.0's constructor has none; 0.6.1
added ``repo_type: Literal["dataset", "bucket"]``. While the ``[lerobot]`` extra
floored lerobot at ``>=0.6.0`` the flagship path was only *docs*-guaranteed: the
resolver happily installed a lerobot that could not serve it at all, and the
runtime guard told the caller "not supported by any released lerobot" - naming no
remedy, because when that text was written none existed.

These tests pin the guarantee end to end:

* every lerobot-bearing extra floors at the version that accepts ``repo_type``,
  and *excludes* 0.6.0 rather than merely admitting a newer release;
* the packaging floor and the version the runtime guard advertises are the same
  value, so the remedy the error message names cannot drift from what the
  resolver installs;
* **executed, not asserted**: a lerobot that satisfies the declared floor really
  does accept ``repo_type``. A purely structural pin would keep passing if the
  capability moved to another release, leaving the floor citing a version that
  no longer delivers it;
* the guard is retained (an environment can carry a pre-existing older lerobot)
  and now names the upgrade as the remedy.
