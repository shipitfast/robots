"""A recorded length of zero is a frame count, not a missing ``length`` column.

:func:`~strands_robots.verify_dataset.read_dataset_episode_indices` reports
per-episode frame counts, and an empty ``frames_per_episode`` is documented to
mean the ``length`` column is unavailable. It scored that availability as
``any(f > 0 for f in frames_per_episode)``, so the one dataset whose every
episode recorded zero frames answered "this dataset carries no lengths" - and
:func:`~strands_robots.verify_dataset.verify_dataset` reads an empty list as
"nothing to compare" and skips its check 2, the check whose entire subject is a
zero-length episode (module docstring, item 2).

The gate was therefore non-monotonic in the damage it grades. A dataset holding
``[5, 0, 0]`` frames named its two empty episodes and exited 1; the strictly
worse ``[0, 0, 0]`` - a whole collection run that wrote metadata and no frames -
was certified ``status="success"``, CLI exit 0, and the header claiming
``total_frames: 900`` beside it went unreported too, because the drift half of
check 3 was gated on the parquet total being non-zero rather than on a length
being available. Adding an episode with real frames was the way to make the gate
notice.

Availability is now whether a length was *read*: a present column with a
recorded ``0`` is a count, while an absent column - and one present but wholly
null, a length that is unknown rather than zero - stays unavailable, so neither
gains a false zero-length verdict. ``min_frames=0`` remains the documented way
to skip the length check.

Fixtures are pyarrow-only (no lerobot, no mujoco) and every assertion is on
observable behaviour: the report's ``status`` / ``problems``, the CLI exit code,
and the counts the reader is handed.
