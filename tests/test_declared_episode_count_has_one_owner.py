"""The episode count a dataset's ``meta/info.json`` declares has ONE verdict.

Five surfaces read ``meta/info.json``'s ``total_episodes`` header: the parquet
cross-check in :func:`~strands_robots.verify_dataset.read_dataset_episode_indices`,
the drift check in :func:`~strands_robots.verify_dataset.verify_dataset`, the
validation-split denominator in ``strands_robots.training.lerobot``, the
episode count ``strands_robots.tools.lerobot_train`` splits, and the parquet-truth
gate in ``strands_robots.tools.run_policy`` - the agent-callable rollout tool that
exists to catch a fabricated episode count. Each graded the same value its own
way, so one file got five answers - and two of those answers were silently
destructive:

* ``int(2.5)`` truncates to ``2``, which is exactly the count a two-episode
  parquet holds, so a header no writer could have produced read as AGREEMENT
  between the two independent metadata sources.
* ``int(1e400)`` raises ``OverflowError``. ``1e400`` is a well-formed JSON number
  that ``json.load`` parses to ``inf``, so a readable file raised out of readers
  whose documented answer is "unknown" - and past the ``verify_dataset_episodes``
  envelope, which documents that a corrupt dataset is "reported as this same
  error dict, never raised".
* ``true`` counted as one episode (``bool`` is an ``int`` subclass), while the
  ``total_tasks`` reader in the SAME module already excluded it.
* ``"2"`` was two episodes to three readers and unusable to the fourth.

:func:`~strands_robots.utils.declared_count` is that one owner. A declaration
outside its domain is "no count declared", and a reader that must not read that
as an absent header reports it: the recorder's helper carries it in
``info_problems``, verify_dataset appends a problem, and the rollout tool warns
(which flips its status to ``error``).

The rollout tool is where coercion cost the most, because a coerced count is the
number it reports to the caller AS parquet truth: ``total_episodes: true``
answered a one-episode request with ``status=success`` and
``parquet-truth: total_episodes=1``, no warnings - a boolean certifying the very
count the tool was written to verify independently, on a file its two sibling
readers both call corrupt.

Fixtures are pyarrow + a raw ``info.json`` string (not ``json.dumps``, which
cannot write ``1e400`` or ``NaN`` from a Python value), so these tests need
neither lerobot nor mujoco. The agent-callable facade is pinned against a real
recorded dataset in ``tests/simulation/test_run_policy_episode_contract.py``.
