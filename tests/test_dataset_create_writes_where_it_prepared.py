"""A dataset is written into the directory ``create`` prepared for it.

``DatasetRecorder.create`` does two things with a dataset directory. It resolves
one through :func:`~strands_robots.dataset_source.resolve_dataset_dir` and
hands it to ``_prepare_create_target``, which inspects it and - under
``overwrite=True`` - deletes it; then it calls ``LeRobotDataset.create``, which
resolves a directory of its own from ``repo_id`` whenever ``root`` is absent.
Those two resolutions are not the same one. ``resolve_dataset_dir`` reads a
``repo_id`` that is itself a path - no ``owner/name`` slash, or ``./``-prefixed -
as a local directory, while LeRobot resolves any absent root to
``$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/{repo_id}`` whatever the id looks like. For those ids the
guard therefore inspected one directory and the writer wrote another.

Measured against lerobot 0.6.2 with the dataset home and the working directory
both redirected into a scratch tree, ``repo_id="sim_recording"``, ``root=None``:

* ``overwrite=True`` with an unrelated ``./sim_recording`` holding one file:
  the file's directory was **deleted** and the dataset was created under
  ``$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/sim_recording``. The delete and the write named different
  places, so what ``overwrite`` consumed was not what it replaced.
* ``overwrite=True`` with a dataset already at ``$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/sim_recording``
  raised ``FileExistsError: [Errno 17] File exists`` and the stale dataset
  survived: the flag could not overwrite, because the wipe was aimed elsewhere.
* ``overwrite=False`` in the same arrangement raised the same bare ``[Errno 17]``
  rather than the message naming ``overwrite=True`` and :meth:`resume` -
  ``_prepare_create_target`` exists to replace that error and was reading a
  directory the write never touched.

``create`` now resolves once and forwards the result as an explicit ``root``, so
the inspected directory is the written directory by construction. The ordinary
``owner/name`` id is unaffected: both resolutions already agreed on
``$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/{repo_id}`` there, which the controls below hold.

``DatasetRecorder.resume`` resolves the same way, for a different reason: it
prepares nothing, so it has no second resolution to disagree with, but LeRobot
refuses an absent root outright there - a writer must not open the Hub snapshot
cache - which left the append entry point unreachable on the arguments ``create``
accepts. See
``tests/test_dataset_append_reopens_what_the_repo_id_created.py``.
