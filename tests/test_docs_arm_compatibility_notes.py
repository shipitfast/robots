"""Repo hygiene: the arms page's capability claims agree with the registry.

``docs/robots/arms.md`` ends in a *Compatibility notes* block whose bullets are
set-membership claims about ``registry/robots.json``: which arms have no sim
asset, and which have a real-hardware path. A reader plans hardware work from
them, so a stale name there is a wrong answer rather than a cosmetic one.

Nothing graded those bullets, and all three claims had gone stale:

* The sim-asset exception named ``hope_jr`` and ``omx``. ``rebot_b601`` also
  declares no ``asset`` block, so it was the third exception and unlisted.
* The real-hardware bullet named ``panda``, ``so100`` and ``ur5e``. Only
  ``so100`` was right - neither ``panda`` nor ``ur5e`` declares a ``hardware``
  block at all, so ``Robot("panda", mode="real")`` refuses with
  ``Unsupported robot type: 'panda'``. The claim mattered because it is the
  opposite of the truth: a reader was told the Franka arms already drive real
  hardware through LeRobot, when LeRobot registers no Franka type.
* "The rest are simulation-only" then misdescribed the nine arms that do have a
  path (``dynamixel_2r``, ``hope_jr``, ``koch``, ``omx``, ``openarm``,
  ``rebot_b601``, ``so101``, ``vx300s``, ``wx250s``).

``tests/test_docs_robot_catalog_coverage.py`` grades the same page and could not
see any of it: its four guards pin catalog-table *membership*, the robot *counts*
and the *Aliases* column, and a capability claim in the prose block is none of
those. This file grades the prose.

Both routes are read from the repo's own sources of truth rather than restated
here, so an arm that gains a driver fails the bullet that should have named it:

* LeRobot: the entry declares ``hardware.lerobot_type``.
  :func:`test_every_declared_lerobot_type_is_one_lerobot_registers` is the
  premise that makes declaring one mean the path works.
* Native: :func:`strands_robots.drivers.registry.get_native_driver_class`
  answers for the name.

Deliberately out of scope: the block's last bullet, about what the ``joints``
count includes. Of the 59 registry robots whose asset compiles here, 50 declare
a ``joints`` value other than the asset's actuator count, so that field is a
loose informational number whose contract needs deciding before it can be
graded - a different question from which arms drive hardware.
