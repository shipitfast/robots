"""Repo hygiene: robot *counts* stated in the docs agree with ``registry/robots.json``.

The registry is the source of truth for what ``Robot("<name>")`` accepts, and
several documents restate its size for humans: the README feature list, the hero
and architecture SVGs, ``docs/architecture.md``, the quickstart "see also" and
the ``docs/robots/`` index cards. Nothing tied those restated numbers to the
registry, so they drifted independently - the tree simultaneously claimed "40+",
"50+" and "68" robots for a registry holding 72.

Membership is no longer restated at all: ``docs/hooks/robot_cards.py`` generates
one card per registry entry on the family pages, so a robot cannot be missing
from the catalog and a card cannot name a robot the registry does not hold.
``tests/test_docs_robot_cards_hook.py`` grades that generator. What is left here
is the numbers, which are still typed by hand:

* The ``test_..._claim(s)_match(es)_the_registry`` guards pin the exact sites
  that quote a count, and their failure message is the string to write, so a fix
  needs no arithmetic.
* :func:`test_approximate_robot_count_claims_match_the_current_decade` allows the
  deliberately round "N+ robots" form, pinned to the current multiple of ten.
* :func:`test_no_robot_count_claim_outside_the_known_sites` is the net that
  catches a *new* claim added somewhere none of the above look. The guards above
  are precise about the sites they know; this one refuses an unknown number.

Counts are derived from ``robots.json`` directly rather than from
:func:`~strands_robots.registry.list_robots`, because ``list_robots()`` also
returns robots registered at runtime through ``register_robot()`` and from the
user registry on disk, neither of which the docs describe. This mirrors the
reasoning in ``tests/test_docs_policy_coverage.py``.
