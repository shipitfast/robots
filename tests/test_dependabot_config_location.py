"""Contract pins for the Dependabot configuration's location.

``dependabot.yml`` is a *configuration* file, not a workflow, and the two live in
different directories. Dependabot reads version-update config from exactly one
path -- ``.github/dependabot.yml`` -- while anything under
``.github/workflows/`` is handed to Actions and parsed as a workflow. This
repository had the file in the second place, which fails in both directions at
once and is silent in the direction that matters:

- **Actions** rejected it on every push to ``main``. It declares ``version:`` and
  ``updates:`` and therefore has neither ``on:`` nor ``jobs:``, so the run failed
  at parse time with ``total_jobs: 0`` and ``created_at == updated_at``. Measured
  on 15 consecutive pushes before the move, i.e. a red run on 100% of pushes,
  which is the kind of permanent red that teaches everyone to stop reading CI.
- **Dependabot** never saw it. ``.github/dependabot.yml`` returned 404, so the
  grouping (``ml-stack``, ``sim-stack``, ``dev-tools``) and both ecosystem entries
  were inert. Nothing reported this, because an absent config is indistinguishable
  from a repository that has not configured Dependabot.

The second half is why this is pinned rather than just fixed. ``AGENTS.md`` >
"Action Pinning" delegates a supply-chain control to the ``github-actions``
ecosystem entry:

    **Dependabot keeps these fresh** via the ``github-actions`` ecosystem entry.
    Do not manually bump tags; merge the Dependabot PR.
    Especially ``pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`` [...] This pin is non-negotiable.

A documented non-negotiable control that no longer runs is worse than one that was
never claimed, so the entry that implements it is asserted here by name.

``test_every_workflow_file_declares_the_two_keys_actions_requires`` is the guard
for the *class* rather than for this file: it is what would have caught the
original placement, and it catches the next config file put in ``workflows/`` as
well. It was non-vacuous at the time of the fix -- 12 of the 13 files there
declared both keys and ``dependabot.yml`` was the only one declaring neither.

These are text assertions rather than parsed YAML because that is the shape the
existing CI-config pins use (``tests/test_codeql_query_filters.py`` and
``tests/test_merge_base_overlap.py`` both read their file this way) and because
``pyyaml`` is an optional dependency here -- a pin that skips when a dep is
missing is not a pin.
