"""An emergency stop that the robot refused is reported, not discarded.

``RobotDeviceDriver.onEmergencyStop`` called ``self._robot.stop_task()`` and
dropped the envelope. Two of the four robot surfaces the driver can wrap answer
a stop with an affirmative "I did not stop": ``G1Driver.stop_task`` reports
``status="error"`` with ``stopped=False`` when its control loop outlasts the
join budget, and ``ReachyDriver.stop_task`` reports a daemon that refused. So
an operator's emergency stop was answered by a single WARNING line saying the
stop was being attempted, while the loop kept writing frames and nothing was
recorded above WARNING.

``Mesh.emergency_stop`` grades exactly that verdict for every peer it fans out
to and logs one that did not stop at CRITICAL, quoting a hardware cutoff as the
remedy. A stop that arrives over Device Connect rather than over the mesh is
the same operator request, so it gets the same accounting.

Why the existing suites were silent: the three files that drive
``onEmergencyStop`` assert ``stop_task.assert_called_once()`` or
``robot.stopped is True`` -- that the CALL WAS MADE, never what it ANSWERED --
and their robot doubles are ``MagicMock``s whose ``stop_task`` returns a
``MagicMock``, which carries no verdict to read.
