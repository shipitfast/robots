"""Every documented ``mode="real"`` invocation must name a real robot and real keywords.

``Robot(name, mode="real", **kwargs)`` is the one documented line that touches
physical hardware, and it is the line a reader copies verbatim. Two things about
it are decided at runtime rather than by the factory signature:

* **The name.** ``Robot()`` resolves it through the package registry, so a
  spelling that is neither a canonical name nor an alias raises ``ValueError``
  before anything is built.
* **The keywords.** ``mode="real"`` resolves the robot's ``hardware.lerobot_type``
  to a lerobot config dataclass, and a keyword is accepted only when that
  dataclass declares it or it appears in the cross-robot forwarding allowlist
  :data:`~strands_robots.hardware_robot._FORWARDABLE_KWARGS`. So the accepted set
  is a property of *the named robot*, not of the factory.
* **The driver.** ``driver="strands"`` - spelled, or declared by the robot's
  registry ``hardware.driver`` - builds the native driver instead, and the
  keywords never reach lerobot: the factory hands them to the driver class,
  which declares every keyword it honours (the constructor contract on
  :mod:`strands_robots.drivers.base`) and is handed nothing else. So for that
  call the lerobot dataclass is the wrong roster in both directions -
  ``calibration=`` is honoured by ``FeetechDriver`` and declared by no lerobot
  config, while ``use_degrees=`` is a lerobot field no native driver declares -
  and the accepted set is the driver's own signature,
  :func:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.constructor_keywords`.

Neither is reachable from a signature. ``Robot`` ends in ``**kwargs: Any``, and
``tests/test_docs_python_examples_are_callable.py`` grades keywords against
signatures - its ``_accepted_keywords`` returns ``None`` (meaning "any keyword
binds") for a callee carrying ``**kwargs``. That is correct for its question and
it makes every ``Robot(...)`` keyword ungraded there, so the two modules are
complementary rather than overlapping: that one asks "would Python bind this
call", this one asks "would the runtime accept these values for this robot".

A block that documents a refusal is a negative example - it prints the exception
as its own output - so it is excluded by :func:`_documents_a_refusal` rather than
being graded as broken.
