"""The headless refusal names ``<allow_env>=<value>``, and says when the variable is set to something that pre-approves nothing.

Before, a script with no operator was told ``Set STRANDS_ROBOT_COMMAND_ALLOW
or BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true``. The natural readings - ``=1``, ``=true``,
``=yes`` - pre-approve nothing, because the variable takes the command's
own spelling (``execute``, ``/cmd_vel``, ``loco.SetVelocity``) or ``*``,
and the refusal came back unchanged with no hint that the value was the
problem. The value is asked of the tool's matcher (the same
``preapproval_setting`` the interrupt's ``how_to_answer`` line uses), so
the two never disagree.

A command is stopped with nobody to ask in two places, and only one of them
said anything: with no ``tool_context`` the refusal named the variable, and
when the host HAD a context but refused to interrupt, the refusal named the
reason and no remedy at all. Both now carry the same sentence from the same
helper. A command the operator DENIED is not one of those places - that
question was answered, so it keeps its bare refusal.

``=*`` is advertised only where it works. The ROS transports match through
``match_blocklist``, which canonicalises ``*`` to ``/*`` and matches nothing,
so a headless ``use_ros`` user who set ``STRANDS_ROS2_COMMAND_ALLOW=*`` on
the refusal's advice got the same refusal back, now saying the value named
"neither this command nor '*'" while offering ``=*`` again. Whether ``*`` is
offered is asked of the matcher, and the test asks the gate itself.
