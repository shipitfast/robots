"""Pins the last-push-approval classifier against four pull requests measured in this repo.

The interesting property of this check is not that it computes a boolean. It is
that it separates two states which every field a status sweep reads renders
identically -- ``reviewDecision: REVIEW_REQUIRED`` with
``mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED`` describes both "nobody has reviewed this yet" and
"the only approval can never count". So the fixtures below are the real
observations, not invented ones, and the control pair is what carries the
argument: #1920 and #1722 share a pusher and differ only in whether the
approving account is a different one. #1920 merged; #1722 has been blocked since
2026-08-01.

See scripts/check_last_push_approval.py, issue #1905, and the "PR Workflow"
section of AGENTS.md.
