"""No recording test resolves its dataset root from the developer's shared cache.

A `repo_id` without a `root` is not a neutral shorthand in a unit test. Both
`DatasetRecorder.create` and every backend's `start_recording` resolve the pair
through :func:`~strands_robots.dataset_source.resolve_dataset_dir`, which
falls back to ``$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/{repo_id}`` -- by default
``~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/{repo_id}`` -- and `_prepare_create_target` then
**resolves and inspects that shared path** before any injected fake dataset
class is reached. So the test writes nothing there, and still reads it.

Measured on ``9e0b77b9``, before the call sites this module guards were given a
root. Instrumenting ``_lerobot_home`` across the whole unit suite recorded
**65 test instances in 4 modules** resolving the shared home, 58 of them onto
the single id ``local/probe``. Planting one unrelated dataset there::

    mkdir -p ~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/local/probe/meta
    echo '{"fps":30}' > ~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/local/probe/meta/info.json

turned ``tests/test_dataset_recorder_fps_domain.py`` plus
``tests/test_dataset_schema_frame_shape_domain.py`` from 133 passed into
**22 failed, 111 passed**, every failure the same ``FileExistsError`` naming a
path in ``$HOME``; removing it returned 133 passed. ``local/probe`` is a name
any scratch script reaches for, so the exposure is latent rather than
theoretical -- and it is hard to attribute, because the failure implicates the
dataset stack and a directory in ``$HOME``, not the test's own resolution.

A `repo_id` is supplied positionally as often as by keyword, and the two forms
are the same exposure. `DatasetRecorder.create("user/data", joint_names=["j1"])`
in ``tests/test_dataset_recorder.py`` resolves ``$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/user/data``
exactly as the keyword form resolves ``local/probe``: measured on the same
commit, one unrelated dataset planted at ``user/data`` took that module from
4 failed to **10 failed** -- six tests, each on the same ``FileExistsError``.
So the rule reads the first positional argument too; a keyword-only rule passes
a file with six live offenders in it.

Why the rule is keyed on the *call site* and not on the resolution:

- Rebinding the dataset home for the whole suite (an autouse fixture pointing
  ``_lerobot_home`` at ``tmp_path``) would close the class in one line, and it
  would also break the one test that legitimately depends on the real default:
  ``test_resolve_dataset_dir_falls_back_to_default_home_when_lerobot_absent``
  asserts the resolved path equals ``Path.home() / ".cache" / ...``. That test
  resolves a path and never touches the disk, which is precisely the
  distinction a home-level guard cannot draw and a call-site rule gets for
  free: it is not a recording call, so this module never looks at it.
- Some guarded call sites are refused *before* the root is resolved (the
  missing-lerobot-extra and no-world guards), so they are inert today.
  Requiring a root of them anyway keeps this rule one line with no exemptions;
  the alternative has to model which guard fires first, which is a fact about
  the implementation and not about the test.

With the roots below supplied, the same instrumentation records exactly **one**
test resolving the shared home -- the fallback test named above, which compares
a path and reads nothing -- and the full unit suite's failure set is unchanged
with a stray dataset planted at all six ids the offenders used.

``DatasetRecorder.resume`` is deliberately not an entry point here. It resolves
the pair through the same resolver ``create`` does, so it does reach the shared
home for an absent root - but it has no ``_prepare_create_target``, so it never
inspects or writes that directory: the resolved path is handed straight to the
injected fake dataset class. The exposure this module guards is the *inspection*
of a shared path before the fake is reached, which is what a planted dataset
turns into a ``FileExistsError``; computing a path nothing reads is not it. The
instrumentation agrees - no ``resume`` test reached the home when it was
recorded, and the ids the ``resume`` tests use are unchanged.

``tests_integ/`` deliberately records real datasets and may want the shared
home, so the scan is scoped to ``tests/``.

Naming a root is necessary and not sufficient. The rule above reads the keyword
and not the value it carries, so ``root="/tmp/ds"`` satisfies it while
reproducing verbatim the failure this module exists to prevent: a fixed absolute
path is shared between every test that names it and with every other process on
the machine, so the verdict still depends on what the host already holds. That
is not hypothetical - ``tests/test_dataset_recorder.py`` named ``/tmp/ds`` and
the test failed on any host where that directory existed, with the same
``FileExistsError`` from the same ``_prepare_dataset_target`` inspection, for a
test whose subject is codec normalisation and which writes nothing. Pointing the
same call at a fresh directory turned it green with no other change.

So the second rule reads the value, and it refuses exactly one shape: a ``root``
given as a string literal. The boundary is deliberate. A literal cannot be
per-test unique, which is decidable from the syntax alone with no false
positives; whereas ``root=root`` with ``root`` bound from ``tmp_path`` earlier in
the function is the idiomatic form 101 of the 194 recording calls use, and
telling that apart from a shared local would need dataflow this module has no
business doing. ``root=None`` is left alone for a different reason: it means
"resolve the shared home", which is a question about the home rather than about
the call site, and the modules that pass it are the ones whose subject is that
resolution.
