"""The UR driver's RTDE client is declared by an extra whose bound this project owns.

``strands_robots/drivers/ur.py`` drives a Universal Robots e-Series arm through
the controller's Real-Time Data Exchange interface, and the whole driver is an
adapter onto two importables: ``rtde_control`` (``servoJ``, ``speedJ``, the
dashboard verbs) and ``rtde_receive`` (joint positions and velocities, the TCP
pose, the safety and robot mode words). Both come from one distribution,
``ur_rtde`` - and no requirement named it. Measured against the checked-in lock,
it was absent from the base install and from every one of the 33 declared extras,
so no install of this project could move a UR arm.

What a reader got instead was ``pip install ur_rtde``: a bare distribution, the
last place in the drivers tree that handed a reader a package whose version this
project does not bound. The two remedies beside it name an extra
(``[crazyflie]``, ``[earthrover]``), which is the form that stays correct when the
requirement moves - the reader installs a capability and the manifest decides the
version.

So ``[ur]`` declares it at the range the driver's own calls need. It is
deliberately left out of ``[all]``: ur_rtde is a compiled Boost/pybind11 binding
whose wheels cover manylinux x86_64/i686 and win_amd64 only, up to cp312, so on a
Python 3.13 interpreter or an aarch64 host pip falls back to the sdist and needs a
C++ toolchain plus Boost. ``[all]`` is the bundle CI and exploration install, and
putting a compiler in front of it would cost every one of those installs. The
driver degrades cleanly without the SDK, so ``[all]`` still imports, registers and
tests it.

The last rule here is the general one rather than a fourth assertion about
``ur_rtde``: **no driver refusal may hand a reader a distribution when an extra
could supply it.** Two hints legitimately name a distribution and both say why -
``panda-py`` is not published on PyPI at all (the Franka binding ships as a
release asset, and a direct URL requirement is denylisted by
``tests/test_dependency_audit.py``), and ``booster_robotics_sdk_python`` is a
vendor wheel pinned to the robot's firmware, so the installed build's vocabulary
is an input rather than something this project bounds. Anything else is the defect
this file fixes, and the next native driver to land will be graded by it.

That a hint is only one step of a longer recipe is not a reason to name a
distribution. The Unitree SDK recipe installs its DDS binding, then clones the
vendor SDK; the binding step names ``[ros2]``, which declares ``cyclonedds`` at
the range this project bounds, and the checkout stays a literal command because
no requirement can spell it. The reader gets the bounded half from the manifest
either way.

A hint may carry a specifier (``pip install 'cyclonedds>=0.10.2,<12'``), and the
exemption table is keyed by the distribution, not the quoted text: the target is
read through :class:`packaging.requirements.Requirement` before the lookup, so a
recorded reason is found whatever bound the hint spells.
