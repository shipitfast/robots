"""One security posture, one owner: the allowlist advisory must follow the transport.

An allowlist configured through ``DEVICE_CONNECT_RPC_ALLOW`` is only a
cryptographic authorization boundary under authenticated transport. Under
insecure transport the caller id is self-asserted, so
:func:`~strands_robots.device_connect._authz.is_authorized_caller` logs a
one-time advisory saying the enforcement is advisory. That advisory is the only
signal an operator gets, and it has to agree with the posture the transport is
actually running.

A ``DeviceRuntime`` resolves that posture from two sources with a documented
precedence - its own ``allow_insecure`` argument first, then
``DEVICE_CONNECT_ALLOW_INSECURE`` - which is the same precedence
:func:`~strands_robots.device_connect.resolve_allow_insecure` implements. The
advisory read the environment variable alone, so it answered only the
lower-precedence half of the question and disagreed with the transport on both
argument paths:

* ``allow_insecure=True`` with the variable unset is insecure and went
  **unwarned**, so a configured allowlist read as a boundary it was not. This is
  the shape the package's own guide documents for ``ReachyMiniDriver``, which
  builds its ``DeviceRuntime`` directly with ``allow_insecure=True`` and no
  environment variable at all.
* ``allow_insecure=False`` while the variable opts in is authenticated and was
  warned about anyway, and the message asserted the variable "is set" as the
  reason - true of the variable, not of the transport.

The pins that existed graded one source each. ``test_insecure_acl_logs_advisory_once``
and ``test_secure_acl_no_insecure_advisory`` both vary only the environment
variable, and ``test_allow_insecure_setting_domain`` grades the resolver in
isolation and never asks whether anything downstream honours its answer. So the
argument - the higher-precedence source - was absent from every cell that grades
the advisory, and the two rows here that vary only the environment are the
controls that hold either way.
