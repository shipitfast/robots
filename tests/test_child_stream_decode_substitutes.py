r"""A child process's stream is decoded with substitution, not strictly.

``subprocess`` in text mode decodes with ``errors="strict"`` unless told
otherwise, so one byte the codec cannot decode replaces the whole captured
stream with ``UnicodeDecodeError``. A child's stdout is not this process's
text: it is whatever bytes an arbitrary program wrote to a pipe - ffmpeg
copying a latin-1 metadata tag, a container printing a log line byte for byte,
a USB descriptor string a vendor chose - so a byte that is not valid UTF-8 is
expected there, not exceptional.

The package had already decided that, twice, for the *same* bytes:

* ``lerobot_train`` / ``lerobot_teleoperate`` read the detached child's log file
  with ``errors="replace"``, and say why - reading it strictly makes one such
  byte raise past the handler that exists to keep the rest of the report.
* the MuJoCo GL probe in ``simulation.mujoco.backend`` captures the child as
  bytes and calls ``.decode(errors="replace")`` on both streams.

The sites that read a child through a *pipe* in text mode did not, and one of
them loses something a caller was promised:

* :func:`~strands_robots.dataset_transfer.sync_dataset_to_bucket` documents
  "Never raises on ``hf`` failure; errors are surfaced in the result dict", and
  ``stop_recording`` calls it unguarded on that promise. The decode happens
  after ``hf sync`` has already run, so an undecodable byte in the CLI's own
  message raised past a completed upload and took the episode/frame report with
  it.
Two boundaries are deliberate. ``encoding=`` is *not* stated: a child inherits
this process's locale and encodes with it, which is the one case
tests/test_on_disk_text_io_states_utf8.py excludes for that reason. And a pipe
this process *writes* stays strict - substituting on the way out would silently
mangle a command instead of refusing to send it.
