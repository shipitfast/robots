"""An agent verb a driver's schema does not declare is refused, not dispatched.

A driver's ``tool_spec`` carries an ``action`` ``enum``. That enum *describes*
the verbs an agent may send; nothing between the model and
:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.HardwareDriver.stream` enforces it. So a
dispatcher whose last branch is a bare ``else`` runs its final verb for every
value the enum does not cover - and on every shipped native driver that final
verb is the *write* one, the halt.

``FeetechDriver`` already refuses, and
``tests/drivers/test_feetech_driver.py::test_an_undeclared_verb_is_refused_not_run``
states why in the past tense: "The fallthrough branch used to be ``stop``, so
any verb outside the schema released torque on every motor and answered
``success``. ``home`` is the one an agent reaches for first - this driver
deliberately does not declare it - and a held payload dropped while the
transcript read as a clean move." That reasoning was never applied to the other
eleven drivers, so on those a typo (``"sensor"``), a verb borrowed from a sibling
(``"sensors"`` on a ``URDriver``, whose read verb is spelled ``state``) or a
non-string all halted the robot and reported ``status="success"``.

The population here is **derived from the registry** rather than listed, so a
driver added later is graded on arrival - the same relation shape
``test_agent_stop_verb_reports_the_halt_outcome.py`` uses for its own fleet
rule. Two things are graded, because the envelope alone is not the safety
property: the refusal must *say* the verb is unknown, and the halt must not
have *happened*.

The vocabulary divergence the fleet already carries is left as it is and only
made visible: ``CrazyflieDriver`` declares ``land`` where its siblings declare
``stop``, and ``URDriver`` declares ``state`` where its siblings declare
``sensors``. Refusing and naming the declared verbs lets an agent correct itself
in the same turn; silently running the halt for both spellings is what this
module refuses.
