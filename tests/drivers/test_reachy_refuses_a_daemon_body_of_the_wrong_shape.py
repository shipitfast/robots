"""A Reachy daemon body is read as the JSON shape it arrived as, or refused.

:func:`~strands_robots.device_connect.reachy_transport.api` hands the decoded
body back unreshaped - ``json.loads`` decodes any JSON value, not only an
object - so what a caller receives is whatever the daemon, or an interposed
proxy, answered with. The rule for that is written down in this transport's
other consumer,
:meth:`~strands_robots.device_connect.reachy_mini_driver.ReachyMiniDriver._transport_failure`:
"the catalogue endpoint answers with a JSON array, so only the callers that
require an object judge that shape". Its own ``getDaemonStatus`` honours it.

The native driver requires an object at six sites and judged it at none. Every
one of them opens with ``result.get("error")``, so an array, a string, a number,
``null`` or ``true`` raised ``AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute
'get'`` out of ``connect_eagerly``, ``wake_up``, ``goto_sleep``, ``stop_task``,
``play_move`` and ``stop`` - methods documented to report a reason and leave the
driver usable, and whose docstrings say ``api`` reports every failure as
``{"error": ...}`` "which is why no call here needs a ``try``".

The catalogue door had the mirror defect: ``list_moves`` graded dict-vs-not, the
wrong axis, so a scalar body came back as ``{"status": "success", "moves":
"ok"}`` - a catalogue that is not one.

Two doubles stand in. The premises class uses a **real** ``http.server`` on an
ephemeral port, because the table below is only meaningful if the transport
really does hand these shapes back; a double asked to return a list proves
nothing about ``api``. The door table then uses the daemon double this suite's
sibling module uses, since what is under test there is the driver's reading of a
decoded body rather than the decode.
