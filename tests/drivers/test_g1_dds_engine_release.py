"""G1 DDS teardown: closing an engine releases readers and writers, not just references.

``DDSSubscriberSet.close`` is the driver's only release path -
:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1.G1Driver.cleanup` calls it and then drops the
set - and ``DDSPublisher.close`` is its sibling on the write path. Both used to
drop their references and rely on garbage collection, which is measurably wrong
for a subscriber: :meth:`DDSSubscriberSet.subscribe` builds every subscriber
with a non-zero queue length, and at any queue length above zero
``unitree_sdk2py`` starts a ``ch_reader`` daemon thread whose target is a bound
method of the channel's reader. The running thread keeps the channel reachable,
so CycloneDDS' ``__del__`` never runs, and ``ChannelSubscriber.Close()`` - which
both docstrings claimed did not exist - is the only thing that stops the thread
and drops the ``DataReader``.

A subscription that outlives ``cleanup()`` matters twice over: the decoder
callback keeps writing caches for a driver that reports itself disconnected,
and the next ``connect_eagerly()`` subscribes the same topics again - the
duplicate that the engine's shared construction lock exists to prevent.

The SDK is absent on a headless runner, so the behavioural cells drive
recording stand-ins that model ``Init``/``Close``. The facts a stand-in cannot
establish - that the real classes *have* ``Close`` - are pinned separately, and
skip where the SDK is missing.
