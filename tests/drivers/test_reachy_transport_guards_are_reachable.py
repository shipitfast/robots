"""Each Reachy transport guard is graded where it is the only thing protecting.

The driver resolves its transport through
:func:`~strands_robots.drivers.reachy._resolve_transport` at four sites, and
``test_reachy_driver.py`` pins the refusal through ``connect_eagerly``,
``send_action`` and ``stop``. That leaves two of the four ungraded, because
``connect_eagerly`` resolves the transport *before* it probes the daemon: with the
pre-check in place neither ``_daemon_get`` nor ``_build_link`` is ever reached with
the extra absent, so a test that drives ``connect_eagerly`` cannot tell whether
those two guards are there at all. Measured against that suite, removing either
one fires nothing.

That matters because the arrangement is defence in depth and the depth is what is
unpinned. ``_build_link`` is documented as an overridable method, and both daemon
helpers are ordinary callables a subclass or a bring-up script can reach without
going through ``connect_eagerly`` first. Grading them here means the pre-check is
not a single point of failure: whichever of the two layers a later change removes,
something fails.

These cells reach each guard directly rather than through the connect path, and the
rest of the file pins what nothing else does - the premise that the extra is a
packaging accident, that the reason reaches a mesh peer, and that a working install
is unaffected.

The absence is simulated rather than installed, since the suite runs where the
transport is importable. :func:`_block_transport` blocks the one module
:func:`~strands_robots.drivers.reachy._resolve_transport` imports, and ``monkeypatch``
restores it. Blocking that module is what ties the simulation to the resolver rather
than to a packaging detail upstream of it: the resolver reports on this import and on
nothing before it, so an absence staged anywhere else is only a refusal by
coincidence. Staging it by making ``device_connect_edge`` unimportable and evicting
the ``strands_robots.device_connect`` subtree - so the next import re-executes an
``__init__`` that fails - stops simulating anything as soon as that ``__init__``
stops needing the extra, and the driver then reaches the real daemon instead of
refusing.
