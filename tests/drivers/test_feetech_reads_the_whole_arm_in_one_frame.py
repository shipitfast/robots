"""``FeetechBus.sync_read`` asks the whole arm once, in the frame it is named for.

``SYNC_READ`` (0x82) is the one Feetech instruction where a broadcast expects
replies: one frame names the register and the IDs, and every addressed servo
answers with a status packet, back to back. Reading a six-servo arm with six
unicast READs instead costs six round trips and six reply settles, and - because
each reply is 8 bytes while the read asked for 10 - each of those round trips
waits out the port's entire read window for two bytes no servo sends.

Three things are graded here, in the order a caller meets them:

1. the frame, against ``scservo_sdk.GroupSyncRead`` driven for real (the vendor
   SDK builds the bytes, this codec must match them) and against
   datasheet-shaped literals so the pin holds on a box without the SDK;
2. the arm being asked *once* - one frame, one settle, no window waited out;
3. what a servo that does not answer costs, which is itself and not the arm:
   it is absent from the reading, its neighbours are present, and a retry
   re-asks only the servos still missing.
