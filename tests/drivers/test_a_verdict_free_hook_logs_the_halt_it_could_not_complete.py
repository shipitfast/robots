"""A verdict-free hook logs a halt it could not complete.

:data:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.DRIVER_SURFACE` carries two ways to halt a
robot and only one of them can answer. ``stop_task`` returns an envelope and
*decides*; ``stop`` is annotated ``-> None`` on every shipped driver, so it
carries no verdict at all. ``tests/drivers/test_agent_stop_verb_reports_the_halt_outcome``
grades the first consequence of that asymmetry - the agent-facing verb must hand
back ``stop_task``'s envelope rather than build one beside the hook - and its own
premise names the second: ``stop`` is verdict-free *because* it logs, "the
Microduck ... logs an ``OSError`` from robotd, the Mini logs a daemon that
declined".

That premise was never graded, and three drivers did not hold it. Each one's
``stop`` delegated to a verb that returns an envelope and dropped it on the
floor:

======================  ====================  ==================================
driver                  discarded envelope    what a refusal leaves running
======================  ====================  ==================================
``BoosterDriver``       ``stop_task()``       the T1 walking, or the host still
                                              holding the upper body
``EarthRoverDriver``    ``stop_task()``       the rover driving at the last
                                              commanded velocity
``CrazyflieDriver``     ``land()``            the aircraft flying
======================  ====================  ==================================

For the two ground robots the refusal is an ordinary hardware failure -
``BoosterDriver.move`` reports a ``RuntimeError`` from ``MoveCommand`` as
``"the T1 refused the twist"``, and ``EarthRoverDriver.send_action`` reports a
``/control`` POST that did not land. Because ``stop`` returns ``None`` and wrote
nothing, a fleet teardown that called it had **no** surface anywhere - envelope,
flag or log - saying the robot had not stopped. ``CrazyflieDriver.land`` re-checks
the link that ``stop`` just checked, so its refusal needs a disconnect racing the
two, which makes it a latent hole rather than a reproduced field failure; it is
fixed here because the rule below is derived from the code and does not have a
category for "discards a verdict, but only rarely".

The relation is what makes the next driver graded on arrival, and it is derived
rather than listed: *a ``stop`` that calls one of its own envelope-returning
verbs must read what that verb answered.* Nine of the twelve shipped drivers
already satisfied it - seven log the failure directly at the wire and two read a
delegated envelope first - so this pins the shape they already have.

That relation only reaches the hooks that *delegate*. Three reached the wire
themselves and guarded it with ``except``, and one of the three - ``RobotiqDriver``
- reported the failure with ``logger.debug`` and did not name the gripper, while
its own ``stop_task`` decided a real verdict for the identical write. The root
logger sits at ``WARNING`` until something lowers it, so that call emitted
nothing at all: the "seven log the failure directly at the wire" above counted a
report no operator receives. A 2F-85 whose halt did not land leaves the fingers
travelling to the last commanded aperture - closing on whatever is between them,
or opening and releasing it - and ``stop`` returns ``None``, so there was no
surface anywhere saying the gripper had not stopped. Hence the second relation,
derived the same way: *a ``stop`` that catches its own wire failure must report it
at a level a default configuration emits, naming the robot.* ``RobotiqDriver.stop``
now delegates to ``stop_task`` like the three above, which leaves that population
the two hooks that really do hold the wire themselves.

``stop`` is not the only verdict-free hook, though: ``cleanup`` is annotated
``-> None`` on all twelve drivers too, and two of them delegated a halt to a verb
that decides one and dropped it exactly as the three above did.

======================  ====================  ==================================
driver                  discarded envelope    what a refusal leaves running
======================  ====================  ==================================
``BoosterDriver``       ``stop_task()``       the T1 walking, or the host still
                                              holding the upper body
``CrazyflieDriver``     ``land()``            the aircraft flying
======================  ====================  ==================================

In this hook the same absence is worse. ``stop`` leaves the robot connected, so a
caller who learns nothing can still ask again; ``cleanup`` goes on to release the
SDK channels and the radio link that a retry would need, so a refused halt it did
not report leaves a walking T1 or an airborne aircraft with nothing in the
process able to reach it - and no envelope, flag or log saying so. The relation is
therefore graded over both hooks rather than restated for the second, and the
release stays unconditional: a teardown that stopped half-way would leak the
channels *and* leave the robot moving.

The wire relation below stays on ``stop`` alone, and that is a scope boundary
rather than an omission. Six ``cleanup`` hooks do catch a failure and report it at
``debug``, but what they caught is a channel or socket close during teardown -
not a halt, and not something an operator can act on. "The robot may still be
moving" and "the socket we were discarding anyway did not close" are different
facts, and only the first is what a verdict-free hook owes a log.
