"""Tests for :class:`strands_robots.drivers.feetech.driver.FeetechDriver`.

Grades the driver's surface, its wired write/read paths, and the refusals that
remain. Nothing here opens a serial port: :class:`FakeServoPort` stands in for
``serial.Serial`` and answers with real status frames, so the codec is
exercised rather than mocked out.

The bus itself is graded in :mod:`test_feetech_bus`; this file grades what the
*driver* adds on top - envelope shapes, the ``.pos`` suffix, the ``bus`` /
``is_connected`` pair the mesh resolves, and the policy verbs still deferred.

The codec is graded separately in :mod:`test_feetech_protocol`. The module-
load pin against ``scservo_sdk`` lives in :mod:`test_feetech_module_load`,
and this file must stay compatible with that pin - importing anything from
:mod:`strands_robots.drivers.feetech` must not pull the vendor SDK.

Structure mirrors :mod:`test_dynamixel_driver` on purpose: a reader who has
read one should recognise the other's test layout on sight. Dynamixel is still
a stub, so its refusals cover verbs this driver now honours.
