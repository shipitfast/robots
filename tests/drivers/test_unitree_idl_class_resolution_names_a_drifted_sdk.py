"""What a Unitree driver reports when the SDK no longer carries an IDL class.

Both Unitree drivers open their sensor topics through a plan of
``(topic, (idl_module, idl_class), decoder)`` rows and resolve each class by
importing the module and reading the attribute off it. That resolution is the
door an SDK version change arrives through: a renamed IDL class, a moved
module, or an SDK that is not installed at all reaches the driver here and
nowhere else. ``_resolve_message_class`` answers with the class or with a
reason string, and :meth:`connect_eagerly` is documented to turn that string
into a named connect failure and leave the driver "usable but not connected"
rather than raising out of bring-up.

The consumer side of that is already pinned - but with a stand-in that returns
a canned reason, so the function that produces the reason an operator actually
reads never runs. Neither refusal arm is executed on either driver, and there
is nothing holding the two copies to the same answers, which is what makes a
drift in one of them invisible.

These cells drive the real resolver on both drivers over the two ways an SDK can
fail to carry a class - the module is not importable, and the module is there
but the class is not - plus the success it has to be distinguishable from, and
then run ``connect_eagerly`` through the real resolver to check the reason
reaches the caller as a return value.

The SDK is absent on a headless runner, so a module registered on
:mod:`sys.modules` stands in for one the SDK ships; the class names come from
the drivers' own subscription plans.
