"""Regression: the FSM-set docstrings do not name a topic ``send_action`` does not write.

Two docstrings in this driver claimed :data:`HANDSHAKE_FSMS` gates writes to
``rt/armsdk``:

* ``strands_robots/drivers/unitree/_common.py`` on the ``HANDSHAKE_FSMS`` constant
  itself: "so :meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1.G1Driver.send_action` checks
  membership before writing ``rt/armsdk``".
* ``strands_robots/drivers/g1.py`` on ``_check_motion_gates``: ":data:`HANDSHAKE_FSMS`
  covers arm-SDK writes (``rt/armsdk``)".

Neither is what the shipped driver does.  Since #2767 landed (2026-08-24)
``G1Driver.send_action`` publishes on ``rt/lowcmd`` -- ``_TOPIC_LOWCMD`` is
`"rt/lowcmd"` and ``_pubs.publish(_TOPIC_LOWCMD, LowCmd_, cmd)`` is the one
write site.  The control loop wired by #2779 writes the same topic on every
step and on stop.  The reader following ``HANDSHAKE_FSMS`` from either docstring
was pointed at a topic string this file does not appear in and could not confirm
by grep, and the two mentions of the real topic in the same module
(``send_action``'s own docstring at line 635 and its scope classification at
line 657) already say "``rt/lowcmd``" -- so the module contradicted itself.

The confusion is worth naming: the arm-SDK-*shape* (the client that talks
:data:`HANDSHAKE_FSMS` at the FSM level) and the arm-SDK-*topic* (``rt/armsdk``,
which the ``g1_tools`` client for issue #358 will write) are not the same
thing.  ``HANDSHAKE_FSMS`` is a set of FSM ids on the motion-switcher rail; the
G1 driver's write for that shape lands on ``rt/lowcmd`` today, and the
``rt/armsdk`` topic name appears in this package only inside the SDK error
table (code 7400 says "``rt/armsdk`` topic is occupied", which is the
firmware's own text and out of scope for this rule) and inside forward-looking
docstrings for the issue #358 tools that do not exist yet.

## Scope

This test grades the two named docstrings only.  The rule is *not* a blanket
ban on the ``rt/armsdk`` substring (which would fire on the SDK error table
for firmware response 7400 and on forward-looking references to the
``g1_tools`` client of issue #358); it is that where either docstring names a
topic in the context of a currently-gated write, ``rt/lowcmd`` must appear.
A docstring that mentions ``rt/armsdk`` alongside ``rt/lowcmd`` (naming
future work explicitly) satisfies the rule; naming only ``rt/armsdk`` does
not.

## Fires on the defect, passes on the fix

Both defect cells fail on ``main @ 5ded625b`` (where ``rt/armsdk`` is the only
topic named beside :data:`HANDSHAKE_FSMS`) and pass after the fix (where
``rt/lowcmd`` is named as today's write and ``rt/armsdk`` is optional
context).  The two premise cells fail vacuously if a future refactor renames
the constant or the write topic, at which point the pin has to move with it.
