"""An ``IMUState_`` vector the message does not carry caches ``None``, not level.

:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1.G1Driver._on_lowstate` read its four IMU
vectors with typed defaults -- ``[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`` for ``rpy``, ``gyroscope``
and ``accelerometer``, ``[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`` for ``quaternion``.  A
``getattr`` carrying a default cannot fail, and every one of those constants is
a well-formed reading of a robot that is upright and still: zero rpy is
perfectly level, the identity quaternion is upright, and a zero accelerometer is
free fall, which a standing robot never reports because gravity always lands on
one axis.  A firmware that renames or drops a field therefore published a
constant shaped exactly like telemetry, to ``strands/{peer_id}/imu`` via
:class:`~strands_robots.mesh.sensors.SensorLoopsMixin`, for as long as the robot
ran.

The rule these tests pin was already kept everywhere else. The twin driver
reads the same four names through the shared coercer
(:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.go2.Go2Driver._on_lowstate`), the same class
reads its battery pack that way one method down (:meth:`G1Driver._on_bms`, so a
renamed field lands ``None`` rather than a plausible zero), the sibling humanoid
states it outright in
:func:`~strands_robots.drivers.booster.parse_low_state` ("a snapshot that
reports a zeroed IMU the robot never sent is worse than one that reports none"),
and the consuming verb ``g1_sensor(sensor="imu")`` documented ``None`` for every field while the
writer made that outcome unreachable.
