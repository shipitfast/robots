"""The LiDAR state decoder reads the field names ``LidarState_`` declares.

``_on_lidar_state`` reaches into the IDL message with
``getattr(msg, name, default)``. That call cannot fail: a name the message type
does not declare yields the default, and the default is a well-formed value
that lands in the published record looking exactly like a reading. So a
decoder that reads a name the IDL never had publishes a constant, and the
fleet card shows a plausible number forever.

The suite has three layers because the SDK that owns the IDL is not on PyPI and
so cannot be a test dependency:

* A *faithful double* carrying exactly the declared field names and nothing
  else. Reading an undeclared name off it produces the default, which is the
  defect, so these cells grade the decoder on any install.
* :data:`_DECLARED_LIDAR_STATE_FIELDS`, a frozen copy of the declaration, and
  a cell that checks it against the real ``LidarState_`` when the SDK *is*
  importable. That is what keeps the double faithful as the IDL moves.
* A derivation over the decoder's own source, so a name added later is held to
  the same rule without anyone remembering to add a case.
