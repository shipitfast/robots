"""Every native ``run_policy`` runs the ``Policy`` its own seam declares.

:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.HardwareDriver.run_policy` types its first
argument :class:`~strands_robots.policies.Policy`, and that class offers exactly
two ways to ask for an action -
:meth:`~strands_robots.policies.Policy.get_actions` and its synchronous wrapper
``get_actions_sync``. It declares no ``step`` and no ``__call__``, and no
subclass in this package adds either.

Two independent failures followed from that, one per admission dialect, and both
are pinned here:

* G1 and Go2 asked for ``step`` or a bare callable, so a built policy was turned
  away at the door with ``policy_object must be callable or expose a .step()
  method`` - the annotation named the one shape the refusal rejected.
* UR resolved ``get_actions_sync`` and so admitted the policy, then refused its
  answer one step later: ``get_actions`` returns a *chunk* (a list whose length
  is the action horizon) and the loop demanded a dict, so the rollout ended at
  step 0 having commanded nothing.

:func:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.policy_step` is the one owner of that
resolution, which is what keeps the set a driver admits and the set its loop can
call from drifting apart again. The untyped shapes keep working: a driver that
already ran a ``step`` object or a bare callable still runs it.
