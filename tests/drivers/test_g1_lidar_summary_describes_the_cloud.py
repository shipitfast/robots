"""A LiDAR summary describes the cloud, not the driver that summarised it.

:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1.G1Driver._on_lidar_cloud` builds the record
the mesh publishes on ``strands/<peer>/lidar/summary``. Every field in it is
read from the ``PointCloud2_`` *header* - ``width``, ``height``, ``point_step``,
``row_step`` - so no point is ever enumerated and nothing is downsampled.

The record nonetheless carried a ``capped_at`` field, copied from a
``lidar_max_points`` constructor parameter, and that parameter had exactly one
reader: the line that copied it into this field. So the summary published
``count: 24000`` next to ``capped_at: 4000``, telling a consumer that the number
beside it had been capped at 4000 when it was the cloud's true uncapped size.
Setting the knob changed only that claim.

The same block's justification named a method that does not exist: a module
comment defended the constant with ":meth:`_summarise_cloud` runs on the DDS
thread", and ``_summarise_cloud`` has no definition anywhere in the tree.

Why the existing coverage was silent: ``tests/drivers/test_g1_driver.py``'s
``test_lidar_cloud_summary_is_bounded`` asserted ``count == 24000`` and
``capped_at == 4000`` in the same body, so the contradiction was pinned rather
than caught. What actually bounds the record is its fixed, header-derived shape,
which that test also asserts via the absence of a point list.

These cells are split so the disposition is graded rather than assumed. The
regression classes fail on the shipped code; the control classes state what must
*not* change - in particular that ``count`` stays the cloud's true size, because
the tempting repair is to clamp it, and a MID-360 that drops from 24000 points
to 3000 is reporting a fault that clamping would hide.
