"""Tests for :mod:`strands_robots.drivers.dynamixel`.

Two subjects, kept apart so a failure in one does not obscure the other:

* :class:`TestProtocol` grades the wire format against expected bytes. Every
  case works from a known-good frame (either hand-computed from the manual or
  a fixture recorded from the Robotis SDK), so a passing test says the codec
  round-trips a real packet, not that it round-trips itself.
* :class:`TestDriver` grades the driver's surface, its stub behaviour, and
  its refusal envelopes. Nothing here opens a port; every path is exercised
  by construction, agent-tool invocation, and direct method calls.

Both suites are hardware-free by construction: the codec is pure and the
driver's I/O paths are the stubs this PR ships.

    A servo watching the bus reads those three bytes as the start of the next

    the inserted byte in ``LEN``. The escape is applied BEFORE the CRC, so the
    CRC covers the stuffed frame -- get that order wrong and every frame
    carrying a run is rejected even though the bytes look plausible.

    Every expected value in this class was produced by Robotis'
    ``dynamixel_sdk`` 4.0.5 -- specifically ``Protocol2PacketHandler``'s
    ``addStuffing`` followed by ``updateCRC``, which is the exact pair its
    ``txPacket`` uses to put bytes on the wire. No serial port is involved:
    the SDK's framing is pure, so it can be used as an oracle on any host.
    The codec here is expected to be byte-identical to it, which is what the
    module docstring claims and what these cases hold it to.

    ``dynamixel_sdk`` is deliberately NOT a test dependency -- it is not
    declared in ``pyproject.toml`` and the point of owning the codec is that
    the wire format is gradeable without it. The vectors are therefore frozen
