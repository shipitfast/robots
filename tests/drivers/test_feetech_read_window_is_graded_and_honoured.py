"""The read window a Feetech caller sets is graded, and reaches the port.

``timeout`` is how long :meth:`FeetechBus._sync_read_once` waits for the arm's
reply stream.
An unusable one does not surface as an error: pyserial accepts ``0``, ``nan``,
``inf`` and ``None`` as a timeout, and each of them makes the read see an empty
buffer that the retry loop cannot tell from a servo that never answered - so
``sync_read`` omits the motor and logs "no verified reply", and a healthy arm
reports as dead servos. That is the same failure ``baud_rate`` is graded to
prevent, in the same constructor, so the window is held to the domain every
other driver holds its timeout to.

The second half is the driver: a window it recorded instead of forwarding is the
case its own ``motor_ids`` comment names - a keyword that changes nothing,
leaving the caller believing the bus is configured.

No serial port is opened. The one cell that grades ``connect`` replaces the
bus's ``require_optional`` with a recorder, which is what makes the number the
port was opened with readable at all.
