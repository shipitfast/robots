"""The Unitree drivers agree on which telemetry fields are readings.

``_on_bms``, ``_on_lowstate``, ``_on_mainboard`` and their siblings decode a DDS
message by reading ``getattr(msg, <field>, None)`` and coercing the result, so
the coercion is what decides whether a field reaches the mesh as a number or as
``None``. That rule was written twice - four functions with identical names in
:mod:`strands_robots.drivers.g1` and :mod:`strands_robots.drivers.go2` - and the
two copies did not agree:

===========================  =======================  =======================
value                        ``g1`` (before)          ``go2`` (before)
===========================  =======================  =======================
``True`` on a scalar field   ``1.0`` / ``1``          ``None``
``bytearray(b"\\x01\\x02")``   ``None``                 ``[1.0, 2.0]``
``memoryview(b"\\x01\\x02")``  ``[1.0, 2.0]``           ``[1.0, 2.0]``
``[True, 2]``                ``[1.0, 2.0]``           ``None``
===========================  =======================  =======================

Each copy guarded a class of value the other let through, and the third row is
the one neither guarded: ``memoryview`` is bytes-like, iterates as integers, and
so decoded a raw buffer into a two-element "quaternion" on both drivers. Every
one of those cells publishes a plausible reading where the field carried none,
which is the exact outcome both decoders' docstrings say the ``None`` default
exists to prevent - a typed default "looks like a reading", and a number derived
from a flag or a buffer looks like one just as well.

The refusal branches were uncovered in both modules, which is how two copies of
one rule came to disagree unnoticed. So the rule now has one owner in
:mod:`strands_robots.drivers.base`, and this suite grades it three ways: the
rule itself as a table, the two decoders end to end, and a derivation over the
driver package that refuses a third private copy.
