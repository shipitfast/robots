"""The Go2 native driver gates, maps and publishes what the Go2 wire expects.

One suite for one driver, table-driven where the behaviour is a family of
refusals, because the thing worth pinning is a *behaviour* and not each constant
it happens to read.

The headline contract is
:func:`test_the_wire_slot_order_is_legid_not_the_description_declaration_order`.
``LowCmd_.motor_cmd`` is indexed by Unitree's ``LegID`` order (front-right,
front-left, rear-right, rear-left) while the Go2's own URDF/MJCF description
declares its joints front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right. Those two
orders are a transposition of each other, so a driver that zipped one onto the
other would command the mirror-image leg with a perfectly valid CRC - a
quadruped that walks sideways with nothing in any log to say why. That is why
:data:`~strands_robots.drivers.go2.GO2_JOINT_INDEX` is keyed by name and why the
mapping is pinned here rather than left to review.

No test here needs a Go2, a DDS bus or ``unitree_sdk2py``: the SDK is stubbed on
:mod:`sys.modules` for the frame-building lanes (the same production code path
hardware drives) and the publisher is a recorder with
:class:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1.DDSPublisher`'s acceptance contract.
