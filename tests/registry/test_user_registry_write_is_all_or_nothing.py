"""A user-registry write stores the whole overlay or leaves it untouched.

Every write to ``user_robots.json`` is a read-modify-write of the WHOLE
document: :func:`~strands_robots.registry.user_registry.register_robot` and
:func:`~strands_robots.registry.user_registry.unregister_robot` both load the
overlay, change one entry and store it back. So a write that lands only
partially does not lose the entry being changed - it loses every robot the
overlay held.

Nothing reports that loss. :func:`parse_user_robots` treats an unparseable
overlay as *no user robots*: it logs a warning and the merged registry falls
back to the package ``robots.json`` alone, so previously registered robots are
simply absent and ``get_robot`` calls them unknown.

Two ways the write could land partially, both closed here:

1. ``json.dump`` encodes straight into the stream it is handed, so a value it
   cannot encode raises only *after* a prefix of the new document has already
   replaced the old one. A ``Path`` or a numpy scalar in the caller-supplied
   ``hardware`` dict is such a value, which made a *rejected* registration
   destroy the overlay it was rejected from - the exact outcome the
   ``_assert_registry_still_loads`` gate one line above the write exists to
   prevent (see ``test_registry_lookup_hardening``, which owns the read-time
   half of that guarantee).
2. Writing into the destination itself truncates it first, so any error partway
   through the commit - a full disk, a crash - leaves a prefix on disk rather
   than the previous good document.

The fix serializes the document in full before the destination is opened and
commits the text through a temp sibling plus ``os.replace``. These pins measure
the property, not the mechanism: after a refused or failed write, the overlay
still reads back exactly the robots it held.
