"""The ``repo_id`` that created a dataset reopens it for appending.

``DatasetRecorder.create`` resolves the dataset directory once, through
:func:`~strands_robots.dataset_source.resolve_dataset_dir`, and forwards the
result to LeRobot as an explicit ``root``. ``resume`` -- the multi-episode append
entry point, and the only writable one for an existing dataset -- forwarded the
caller's ``root`` unresolved instead. An absent one therefore stayed absent, and
``LeRobotDataset.resume`` refuses that outright::

    resume() requires an explicit 'root' directory because it creates a
    DatasetWriter. Writing into the revision-safe Hub snapshot cache (used when
    root=None) would corrupt the shared cache. Please provide a local directory
    path.

The refusal is correct about LeRobot's own resolution and asks for a directory
this repo already names: the one ``create`` wrote the dataset to. So append was
unreachable on exactly the arguments ``create`` accepts, which is the documented
default path. Measured end to end against lerobot 0.6.2 on a MuJoCo scene --
``start_recording(repo_id="probe/append_two_episodes", root=None,
overwrite=True)``, a 30-step rollout, ``stop_recording()``, then the same
``start_recording`` call again with the default ``overwrite=False``:

* the first session wrote one episode, every call ``status="success"``;
* the second returned ``status="error"``, "Dataset init failed: resume()
  requires an explicit 'root' directory ...", having already resolved that
  directory to decide an append was wanted and stashed it as
  ``last_dataset_root``;
* ``verify_dataset_episodes(expected=2)`` then reported 1 episode / 30 frames.

With ``resume`` resolving once, the same script records 2 episodes / 60 frames
and every call reports success.

Every existing fake dataset class accepts ``root=None`` silently, so none of them
could observe this; the double below reproduces the one property that decides the
outcome -- a writer refuses an absent root -- and is what makes the cells here
fail on the unresolved forward rather than merely describe it.

An explicit ``root`` is unaffected: it was, and still is, used verbatim.
