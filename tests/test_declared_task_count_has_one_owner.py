"""The task count a dataset's ``meta/info.json`` declares has ONE verdict.

``total_tasks`` decides whether a global held-out episode COUNT is expressible
at all. lerobot applies a validation split as one ``eval_split`` FRACTION and
holds out ``ceil(episodes_in_task * eval_split)`` from every task independently
(``lerobot.datasets.factory.make_train_eval_datasets``), so a single fraction
reproduces a requested global count only on a single-task dataset.
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.validation_split_error` is the guard that refuses
the request rather than quietly reserving a different number of episodes.

Two surfaces read the header and hand it to that guard: the ``lerobot_train``
tool and :class:`~strands_robots.training.lerobot.LerobotTrainer`. Both used to
convert it first - ``total if isinstance(total, int) and not isinstance(total,
bool) else 0`` - and 0 is the value the guard honors as "no task count
recorded", so every declaration outside a bare ``int`` arrived as the absent
case. A three-task dataset whose header spelled its count ``3.0`` or ``"3"``
passed the guard written to refuse exactly that dataset, and lerobot then took
the ceiling once per task.

The declaration is now graded by :func:`~strands_robots.utils.declared_count`,
the one owner every reader of a LeRobot header count already shares, and a
header that declares something which is not a count is a THIRD outcome - refused
on its own terms rather than collapsed into the absent case.

Fixtures are raw ``info.json`` text (not ``json.dumps``, which cannot write
``1e400`` or ``NaN`` from a Python value), so these tests need no dataset files
beyond the metadata.
