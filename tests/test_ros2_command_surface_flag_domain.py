"""A read-only ROS 2 bridge stays read-only, whatever spelling asked for it.

``Robot(ros2_bridge=True)`` can expose an inbound ``/<robot>/joint_command``
topic that drives a physical arm, and ``docs/security/hardware.md`` names the flag that
closes it as the ungated posture: "Telemetry-only is ungated. ``ros2_commands=
False`` is publish-only (no inbound surface) and needs no security config."

That promise is only as good as how the flag is read. Every non-empty string is
truthy, so ``"false"``, ``"no"``, ``"off"`` and ``"0"`` - the spellings a
YAML/env deployment config yields for a disabled feature - each select the
*permissive* posture when the flag is read by truthiness. ``None``, ``0``,
``""`` and ``[]`` take the other branch without ever being a declared spelling
of it. Nothing raises and nothing logs, so on the rclpy transport a read-only
request became a live arm-driving subscription indistinguishable from a full
duplex one, and ``ros2_bridge="false"`` built a bridge - with commands enabled by
default - for a caller who asked for none.

The DDS Security gate does not stand in for the check, and on the pure-RTPS
transport it inherits the same inversion: ``_require_secure_command_surface``
branches on this flag, so a truthy non-boolean makes it refuse a *read-only*
request with a message about "an enabled command bridge" and advise the
``STRANDS_ROS2_BRIDGE_I_KNOW_THIS_IS_INSECURE`` opt-out - the one remedy that
turns the refusal into a silent open of the surface the caller asked to close.

So the three entry points that accept this posture - ``Robot._init_ros_bridge``
(reached from ``Robot(...)``, the documented route) and the two publicly
exported bridge classes - check it on the shared ``boolean_flag_error`` domain.
The tests below parametrize over that domain rather than a copied spelling list,
so a spelling it grows is covered without an edit here, and each guard is
asserted to land ahead of its transport dependency so the refusal reports
identically with and without the ``[ros2]`` extra.
