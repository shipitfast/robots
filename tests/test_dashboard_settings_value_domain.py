"""A settings value that is not usable is refused or degraded, never published.

``settings`` coerces on two paths. The strict one (UI / API writes, via
:func:`~strands_robots.dashboard.settings.update_strict`) REPORTS an unusable
value. The lenient one (the settings file, the environment, the CLI, via
:func:`~strands_robots.dashboard.settings.update` and
:func:`~strands_robots.dashboard.settings.load`) cannot report to anyone, so it
degrades - and the module states the rule that makes degrading safe: it must
degrade to *the key's own shape*, because "a list key that fell back to a scalar
poisons every comma-split consumer, which is worse than the empty default".

That rule was applied to the list keys and omitted for the one boolean key,
``runtime.trust_remote_code`` - whose consumer is the remote-code execution
gate. The lenient path returned the value that had failed
to be a boolean, so a non-boolean sat in a boolean slot, and
:func:`~strands_robots.dashboard.settings.apply_mesh_env` publishes that key by
TRUTHINESS. A spelling like ``"maybe"`` was therefore published as the literal
``"1"`` - which is exactly what
``policies.factory._check_trust_remote_code`` accepts, since its allowlist is
``("1", "true", "yes")``. The same spelling reaching that gate directly is
refused. So the settings layer converted a value the gate rejects into the one
it accepts, off a typo in ``settings.json``, while the API path refused the very
same value by name.

``test_an_unreadable_spelling_does_not_open_the_remote_code_gate`` is the cell
that discriminates: it drives the real gate and fails against the passthrough.
The rest pin the two paths' answers across the whole value domain as one table,
so a key added to the schema without a domain is visible, and the spellings that
legitimately mean true or false are pinned as controls - they pass either way,
which is what keeps the fix from reading as "refuse more things".

And it reached two of the four numeric keys, not four.
``TestANonFiniteNumberIsReportedNotRaised`` covers the half it missed: the two
whose shape is a float go through ``_finite_float``, which refuses a non-finite
by name, while the two whose shape is an integer converted with a bare ``int()``
whose ``except (TypeError, ValueError)`` does not catch the ``OverflowError``
that ``int(float("inf"))`` raises. So neither path answered - the strict one
raised instead of reporting the key, and the lenient one raised out of ``load``
itself, taking the whole tree with it rather than degrading one value.

Those rows are a class of their own rather than four more ``_UNUSABLE`` entries
because the lenient column there is resolved through the settings FILE, and a
file cannot carry a non-finite at all: ``json.dumps`` writes it as the bare
``Infinity`` token, which ``_read_file`` already refuses as corrupt (see
``test_a_value_the_file_cannot_hold_heals_to_the_default``), so those rows would
pass through the healing path without reaching the coercion under test. The
lenient vector that does reach it is ``override`` - a process-scoped value,
which is also what made the failure permanent for the life of the process.
The four keys are one roster in the module now, rather than a literal tuple per
path, and one cell here holds this table to it - so a numeric key added to the
schema is held to this domain rather than quietly escaping it.
