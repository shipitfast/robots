"""Grade the mesh audit log environment reference against the code's env surface.

``docs/security/audit-log.md`` names the credentials operators must configure to secure a
fleet: the transport TLS material, the IoT credentials the AWS backend reads,
and the mesh subscribe allow-list.  It does not, until this file's companion
change, name the environment variables that configure the *audit log itself* -
the JSONL write path, the size and file caps that bound disk use, and the PSK
that turns the log's per-record HMAC on.  A reader who followed the page
believed the transport was hardened and the actions surface was gated, and
never saw the four variables that decide where the audit trail lives and
whether it can be forged.

Two properties are graded here, both derived from the package rather than from
a list kept alongside it - so a variable added to ``mesh/audit.py`` later is
graded on arrival:

- **Every audit variable the module reads is documented.** A variable the
  audit surface honours but the page omits is a setting nobody configuring an
  audited fleet can find. That is the pattern harness#376 tracks across ~58
  ``STRANDS_*`` names; this file pins the four that touch the audit log.
- **The audit variables are documented under one heading.** The four names
  configure one channel (the audit log file) and its integrity check (the
  PSK), so an operator turning on tamper-evidence should find them together,
  not split between "Credentials and secrets" and "Telemetry exposure".

The behavioural fact the rule exists to make discoverable is asserted too:
with the PSK unset, the audit log accepts a record and re-reads it as-is; the
HMAC field is absent and the sequence-restore step trusts the file.  That is
the failure mode - an operator who never saw ``STRANDS_MESH_AUDIT_PSK`` cannot
know the tamper-evidence contract is off - and it holds on both sides of this
change, so it is what the four documentation bullets exist to name.

# --- The claims the section makes, graded against the module ----------------
#
# The four rules above grade whether each variable is *named*.  They cannot see
# whether what the page says *about* a variable is true, and two of the first
# section's claims were not: it promised that a process which cannot open the
# log "refuses to start the auditor, rather than running with the audit trail
# silently off" (the inverse of ``log_safety_event``'s documented fail-soft
# contract), and it named the persisted HMAC field ``hmac`` (the module writes
# ``sig``).  Both survived a green suite because a presence rule is satisfied by
# a bullet that mentions the variable, whatever the bullet asserts.
#
# The rules below close that gap on the two axes an operator or an external
# verifier actually builds against:
#
# - **the persisted record schema**, derived from the module's own dataflow, so
#   a field name in the page that no record carries fails here rather than in
#   somebody's SIEM rule; and
# - **the failure posture**, so the page cannot promise fail-closed behaviour
#   for a writer whose contract is fail-soft.
#
# The posture rules are scoped to this one section deliberately: ``refuses to
# start`` appears twice elsewhere in ``docs/security/audit-log.md`` and once in
# ``docs/rtps-integration.md`` about ``HardwareRtpsBridge``, where it is
# accurate - that bridge really does refuse to construct without DDS Security
# material.  A page-wide phrase rule would flag those true claims, so the
# scope is the audit section and the derivation is the audit writer.

#: Refusal-to-start phrasings.  The negative rule catches the specific false
#: assurance; the positive rule (the section must describe the swallow) is the
#: half that survives a rewording, since a bullet reinstating a fail-closed
#: claim has to delete the swallow sentence to be coherent.
