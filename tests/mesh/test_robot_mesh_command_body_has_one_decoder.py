"""A malformed ``robot_mesh`` command body is refused through the tool's envelope.

``robot_mesh`` takes ``command`` as free-text JSON an agent writes, and four
sites used to decode it inline behind ``except json.JSONDecodeError``. That
subclass covers malformed syntax and nothing else, while :func:`json.loads`
fails on a caller string three ways:

* malformed syntax -> :class:`json.JSONDecodeError`,
* a number wider than :func:`sys.get_int_max_str_digits` -> a plain
  :class:`ValueError` (well-formed JSON this build cannot construct an ``int``
  for; RFC 8259 bounds no range),
* a document nested past the interpreter stack -> :class:`RecursionError`, a
  :class:`RuntimeError` outside :class:`ValueError` entirely.

So two of the three escaped. On the two pre-pass sites inside :func:`robot_mesh`
the escape is an exception raised past the tool's own ``{"status": "error"}``
envelope, and no audit row for a ``broadcast`` or ``send`` that never reached
the wire -- while every refusal beside them writes one, including the
same-function ones for a missing body and a body that is not an object. On the
two Device Connect sites the dispatcher's outermost ``except Exception`` absorbs
it and reports a caller's malformed body as ``"Device Connect error"``, naming a
transport that was never dialled.

Why the suite did not catch it: every existing cell drives ``"not json"`` or a
non-object body (``tests/test_robot_mesh_dc_dispatch_errors.py``,
``tests/mesh/test_robot_mesh_command_validation.py``), which are exactly the two
spellings the narrow handler gets right. Those cells hold unchanged here and are
the controls below.

The wording rule is the one the ACL loader already applies: a document that is
nested too deeply, or that carries a number too wide, is *valid JSON* this build
cannot read, so reusing "is not valid JSON" would send the operator hunting a
syntax error that is not there.
