"""Regression: broadcast() must collect acks for the FULL window, not return
~0.3s after the first response.

``broadcast`` waited on an Event that ``_on_response`` sets on the FIRST reply,
then slept only 0.3s more -- so ``emergency_stop``'s ``responses_received``
systematically under-counted the fleet: an operator could not distinguish
"1 of N robots acknowledged the stop" from "all N acknowledged". The window
must be honoured in full so every peer that replies within it is counted.
