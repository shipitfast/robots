"""Input-validation contract for the ``robot_mesh`` dispatcher.

``robot_mesh`` validates the ``broadcast`` / ``send`` / ``tell`` command
bodies *before* any mesh dispatch or human-in-the-loop approval gate, and
always returns a structured ``{"status": "error", ...}`` dict (it never
raises out of the dispatcher). These tests pin that fail-closed contract so
a malformed agent tool call is rejected with an actionable message instead
of reaching the transport.
