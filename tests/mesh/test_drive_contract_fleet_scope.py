"""Which drive guarantees are fleet-wide, and which only some platforms keep.

Four mesh classes expose the same ``drive(linear, angular, duration, count)``
call over three transports and two message layouts, and an operator or agent
that learns the contract from one drives the others with it. Three of the
guarantees really are kept by every class they are measured on - the numeric
domains every value is checked against, the single-shot latch, and the trailing
zero Twist - while the velocity clamp and the ``max_duration`` ceiling are kept
by ``RosbridgeRobot`` and ``AckermannRosRobot`` only.

The trailing zero is the guarantee this file was written for, because it is the
one that decides whether a *timed* drive can leave a live velocity behind. It
was ``RosbridgeRobot``'s alone: ``RtpsRobot("rover", "/cmd_vel").drive(
linear=1.0, duration=5.0)`` published fifty Twists at 1.0 m/s and then stopped
publishing, leaving the last one latched in the robot's controller, while the
prose read as though it self-stopped. Consolidating the drive contract onto the
shared mobile base made the prose true instead of correcting it downwards, and
the assertions below moved with the measurement - which is the direction this
file is meant to push.

Every check here therefore *measures* each guarantee on all three bridges and
grades the prose against the measurement, rather than pinning either half to a
hardcoded expectation. A bridge that later gains the trailing stop makes the
scope assertion fail, which is the intended signal: the guarantee has become
fleet-wide and the two places that scope it have to say so. That is not
hypothetical - it is what happened to the trailing zero.

The classes each guarantee is measured over are *derived*, not listed, because a
scope claim can only be graded against the whole fleet: a class that owns
``drive`` and lives in a public module of ``strands_robots.mesh`` is a shipped
platform bridge, and a fifth one fails the inventory below until it is given a
case. Two guarantees are read off the content of a ``Twist`` and so are measured
on the three ``Twist`` bridges only - an Ackermann car halts with a zero
``ServoCtrlMsg``, the same exclusion ``test_bridge_stop_tool_parity.py`` states
for the same reason. The other three are read only from whether a call was
forwarded at all and whether two requests forward the same thing, which is true
of any message layout, so they are measured on every drive-owning class.
