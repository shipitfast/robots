"""A :class:`RosbridgeRobot` command must reach the ``use_rosbridge`` operator gate.

The fourth of four. ``tests/mesh/test_ros_bridge_command_gate.py``,
``tests/mesh/test_rtps_robot_command_gate.py`` and
``tests/mesh/test_ackermann_command_gate.py`` each pin that their bridge's
commands reach the shared operator gate of
:mod:`strands_robots._command_gate`; the rosbridge bridge had no such
suite, and it was the one class that could not carry an operator's decision at
all. Measured against the real ``use_rosbridge`` with an operator standing by to
approve, on the same blocklisted ``/cmd_vel`` surface::

    RtpsRobot.stop(tool_context=ctx)       -> success, 1 message published
    RosbridgeRobot.stop()                  -> error, "No tool_context available
                                              for operator approval", 0 published

``RosbridgeRobot.drive`` and ``.stop`` took no ``tool_context`` parameter and its
two commanding agent tools were not declared ``@tool(context=True)``, so there
was nothing for the gate to ask with: every command this bridge sent to a
blocklisted surface failed closed, and the only remedy it could offer was the
blanket ``BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT`` or a standing pre-approval. The halt was the
worst case - the one control the ``tools`` contract guarantees ("a caller that
can start motion must be able to end it") was the one an operator present and
willing could not authorise.

``tests/mesh/test_rosbridge_robot.py`` cannot see any of that: it patches the
``use_rosbridge`` symbol at the mesh boundary, which is the boundary the gate
lives behind. These tests keep the real ``use_rosbridge`` and double the roslibpy
WebSocket client beneath it instead - the same boundary
``tests/tools/test_use_rosbridge.py`` doubles - so the gate and the transport
wiring both run unmodified while nothing reaches a real rosbridge server.

The structural half is derived over every drive-owning class rather than listed,
because "a command can carry an operator's decision" is a fleet property: a
fifth mobile base fails it on arrival instead of shipping unapprovable the way
this one did. ``tests/mesh/test_mobile_base.py`` grades only the classes that
inherit the shared base, which is exactly why it never covered this one.
