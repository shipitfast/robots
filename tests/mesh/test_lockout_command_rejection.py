"""Emergency-stop lockout command-rejection wire + audit contract.

When the e-stop lockout is engaged, ``Mesh._dispatch`` raises
``LockoutError`` for any actuating action (everything except ``status`` and
``resume``). ``Mesh._exec_cmd`` must translate that into the same observable
shape as every other rejection on the security boundary:

  * a ``type="error"`` envelope on the requester's response topic whose error
    string is the deliberately generic ``"command rejected"`` -- a remote
    caller must not be able to use the wire response to map the lockout
    window, so the message carries no lockout-specific detail; and
  * a ``command_rejected_lockout`` audit record carrying the sender and the
    rejected action, so post-incident forensics can see actuation attempts
    made while the fleet was halted.

``status`` and ``resume`` are exempt so an operator can still poll state and
lift the lockout while it is engaged; a ``status`` probe during lockout must
flow through to a normal response and emit no rejection audit.

These pin the lockout branch of ``_exec_cmd`` which was otherwise only
reachable through a live Zenoh e-stop broadcast.
