"""The Ackermann bridge's commands must reach the ``use_ros`` operator gate.

Every :class:`AckermannRosRobot` command forwards to the shared ROS 2
transport, whose command
gate refuses a safety-critical surface when no operator context is reachable.
The surfaces this bridge drives are the DeepRacer's servo topic and the two mode
services that arm the vehicle, and all three are blocklisted - so a bridge that
forwards no context turns its whole command surface, ``stop`` included, into a
per-call refusal, while a bridge whose surfaces are *not* on the blocklist sends
throttle commands with no prompt, no allowlist check and no audit row.
``tests/mesh/test_ackermann_robot.py`` can see neither: it patches the
transport symbol at the boundary the gate lives behind.

These tests keep the real gate wiring and substitute the rclpy helpers
instead (the same boundary ``tests/tools/test_use_ros.py`` doubles), so the gate
and the bridge wiring under test both run unmodified while no message can reach
a real DDS graph. They are the Ackermann half of
``tests/mesh/test_ros_bridge_command_gate.py``;
:class:`TestEveryCommandingMeshBridgeHasAGateSuite` derives the set of bridges
owing such a suite from the tree, so a fifth one is graded on arrival rather
than shipping ungated the way this one did.
