"""Every mobile-base bridge that can start motion also exposes a stop tool.

All three transports publish a *latching* velocity command: with no ``duration``
a single ``cmd_vel`` message leaves the base moving until another command
arrives. :class:`~strands_robots.mesh.RosbridgeRobot`'s own drive tool
description states that contract - "without duration the last command latches
until stop" - and every bridge carries a public ``stop()`` that publishes a zero
``Twist``.

Two of the three exposed that halt as a named agent tool. The ROS 2 bridge did
not, so an agent handed ``RosBridgedRobot.tools`` could start motion and had no
tool to end it; its only halt was a ``drive`` at zero velocity, which is exactly
the idiom ``stop()`` exists to name. These tests pin the parity behaviourally on
every transport, and structurally require any future bridge owning a
``drive``/``stop`` pair to expose the halt too.

They also drive the remaining forwarding closures each ``tools`` property
builds. That is what kept the gap invisible: of the ten closures these three
bridges construct, four were never invoked through the tool, so nothing
observed which capabilities the surface actually reached.
