"""The documented mesh configuration must name the transport selector.

``STRANDS_MESH_BACKEND`` is the variable that decides which transport a fleet
runs on. :mod:`strands_robots.mesh._backend_select` owns its vocabulary, and
two readers consult it: ``session._backend_choice`` on every publish path, and
``transport.factory.get_transport`` once that verdict is ``iot`` or ``bridge``.

The documented half was the dependency, not the selector. ``[mesh-iot]``
appears in four pages and ``STRANDS_MESH_BACKEND`` appeared in none, while
``docs/security.md`` stated the mechanism as "Adding the ``[mesh-iot]`` extra
routes traffic through AWS IoT Core". Installing the extra routes nothing: the
default is ``zenoh`` and stays ``zenoh`` until this variable is set. So a
reader who followed the page installed the dependency, believed the fleet was
on IoT, and got Zenoh - and the one variable that would have moved it was not
in the matrix README.md's own IoT section points them at (docs/reference/configuration.md).

That is the same shape ``tests/test_docs_device_connect_env_reference.py``
exists for, where ``REACHY_DAEMON_TLS`` - the knob that encrypts a link - was
undocumented while the credential that link carries was listed, and a reader
configured half a posture. A selector documented only by its dependency is half
a configuration.

Three properties are graded, all derived from
:mod:`strands_robots.mesh._backend_select` rather than from a list kept beside
it, so a fourth transport is graded the hour it lands:

- **The selector is documented, in the matrix the IoT section points at.**
- **The documented spellings are exactly the vocabulary the resolver accepts.**
  A row advertising a value the resolver refuses sends a reader to a silent
  fallback; a value the resolver accepts and the row omits is a transport
  nobody can find.
- **No page states the extra as the thing that routes traffic.** A paragraph
  that names the extra and makes a routing claim has to name the selector too,
  or it reproduces the reading this guard exists to close.

The behaviour those rules exist to make discoverable is asserted directly too:
with the extra's dependency importable and the variable unset, the resolver
still answers ``zenoh``. That is a fact about the code, not about any page, so
it holds on both sides of this change - it is the reason the omission mattered.

Scope. ``tests/test_docs_mesh_join_is_opt_in.py`` and
``tests/mesh/test_mesh_env_opt_in_documented_default.py`` grade ``STRANDS_MESH``,
which decides whether a robot joins a mesh at all - a different variable and a
different question from which transport it joins over. Neither reads this one.

Deliberately not graded: the other nineteen ``STRANDS_MESH_*`` variables the
package reads and no page documents. They are rate, size and path knobs *within*
a transport, and which of them are public API is a decision this guard should
not make. The selector is separable because it is the only one of them whose
accepted values the package enumerates in a module constant, which is what lets
a rule about its documented spellings be derived rather than restated.
