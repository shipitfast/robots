"""An :class:`RtpsRobot` command must reach the ``use_rtps`` operator gate.

The sibling of ``tests/mesh/test_ros_bridge_command_gate.py``, for the other
transport that reaches a ROS 2 graph. The RTPS transport gained the shared
operator-approval gate of :mod:`strands_robots._command_gate`, so an
:class:`RtpsRobot` whose transport dropped the injected context would turn its
whole command surface - including the ``stop`` halt and the trailing zero of a
timed drive - into a per-call refusal whose only offered remedy is the blanket
``BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT``.

``tests/mesh/test_rtps_robot.py`` cannot see that: it patches the
``rtps_action`` symbol at the mesh boundary, which is the boundary the gate
lives behind. These tests keep the real participant and double the DDS backend
beneath it instead - the same boundary ``tests/tools/test_use_rtps.py`` doubles -
so the gate and the transport wiring under test both run unmodified while no
sample reaches a real DDS graph.

What that buys over the structural checks in ``tests/mesh/test_mobile_base.py``:
those decide forwarding by scanning the transport's source for a
``tool_context=`` keyword, so forwarding a literal ``None`` reads as forwarding
the parameter and the reported defect can be reintroduced by a one-token edit
with nothing failing. The cases here assert an outcome, which makes the
operator's answer an input to what the robot does.

The doubles resolve the interface the robot declares and refuse the rest, the
way :func:`strands_robots.rtps.idl.get_type` does. A resolver that answered every
type string would hand back a velocity message whatever the robot asked for, so
``cmd_vel_type`` would stop being an input to any assertion here and a robot that
declared an interface with nowhere to put ``linear.x`` would still read as having
driven.
