"""Grade the AWS IoT credential reference against the transport's env surface.

``docs/security.md`` owns the cross-network fleet section, and that section is
where an operator configures the AWS IoT Core path. Three properties are graded
here, each derived from the package rather than from a list kept beside it, so a
variable added later is graded on arrival:

- **Every variable the transport reads is documented.** Both the ``iot`` and
  ``bridge`` backends construct :class:`IotMqttTransport` with no arguments, so
  these variables are the whole of its configuration. A variable the code
  honours and the page omits is a setting nobody can find: all four were
  undocumented across ``docs/`` and ``README.md`` while this very section told
  the reader to provision, scope and rotate the credentials they point at.
- **The credentials of one link are documented in one place.** They configure a
  single channel - one names the Thing, one the broker, two locate the
  certificate material - so a reader configuring that link should find them
  together rather than assemble it from two sections.
- **The provisioner and the page agree.** ``ProvisionedThing.env_vars`` is the
  package's own answer to "what must an operator export", so a name it hands out
  and the page does not explain is a gap between two in-tree surfaces.

The behaviour that makes the omission matter is asserted directly too: with the
credentials unset, ``connect()`` returns ``False`` and reports the missing
variable by name. That is a fact about the code, true on both sides of this
documentation change - it is why a reader who cannot find the names discovers
them one ERROR at a time, and why the peer is simply absent from the fleet until
they do.

Scope: the selector that chooses this transport, ``STRANDS_MESH_BACKEND``, is
documented by the change that names it and is deliberately not graded here.
These rules cover the credentials the selected transport then reads.
