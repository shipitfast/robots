"""``IotMqttTransport`` refuses a connect timeout it cannot spend.

``connect_timeout`` is the third surface in the library to carry that exact
parameter name, and it was the one left without a domain. The other two are the
remote-inference clients settled by #1984 -
:class:`~strands_robots.inference.RemotePolicy` over WebSocket and
:class:`~strands_robots.policies.lerobot_async.LerobotAsyncPolicy` over gRPC -
whose contracts live in :mod:`tests.test_remote_client_timeout_domain`. That
module's own framing is why this one was missed: it settled "the knobs left
behind on the same two constructors", and the survey it describes was scoped to
remote-inference clients. A mesh transport spelling the same knob the same way
sat outside it.

What the transport does with the value makes an unusable one worse than a late
crash, because ``connect()``'s failure report cannot tell it apart from a broker
that is genuinely unreachable. It spends the budget on ``threading.Event.wait``,
and measured against a fake broker whose CONNACK arrives 50 ms after ``start()``
(a real one is a network round trip, never instant):

* ``0``, ``-1`` and ``nan`` make ``wait`` return ``False`` in ~0 ms, so
  ``connect()`` logs "IoT connection to ... timed out after 0.0s", stops the
  client that was connecting normally, and returns ``False``. The operator is
  pointed at the endpoint, the certs and the broker - the three things that were
  not wrong.
* ``inf`` and ``'15'`` raise ``OverflowError`` / ``TypeError`` from the ``wait``
  itself. That call sits *after* the ``try`` that contains client construction,
  so the exception leaves a method documented to return ``bool`` with the MQTT5
  client started and no ``stop()`` on any path.
* ``None`` is not a spelling for an unbounded wait. ``Event.wait(None)`` blocks
  forever, and ``connect()`` holds ``self._lock`` for its whole body, so
  :meth:`close` and every subscription call block behind it with no deadline.
* ``True`` is a silent one-second budget, arriving through ``bool`` being an
  ``int`` subclass.

The domain is therefore :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_finite_number_error`
unchanged - the same function, the same message shape, the same reasoning the two
clients already record. The guard sits in the constructor rather than beside the
wait so that it also precedes the ``awsiot`` import inside ``connect()``: the same
caller mistake then reports identically whether or not the ``[mesh-iot]`` extra is
installed, which is the property the gRPC client's own comment names.
