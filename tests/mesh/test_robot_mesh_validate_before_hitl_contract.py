"""Pin: both validate-before-HITL contract guards in ``robot_mesh``.

``robot_mesh`` parses and validates the ``send`` / ``broadcast`` JSON command
body BEFORE raising the human-in-the-loop interrupt, so the operator approves
the validated form rather than the raw model-authored string. Each handler then
re-reads that pre-validated command from a sentinel local
(``validated_send_cmd`` / ``validated_broadcast_cmd``) and refuses outright when
the sentinel is still ``None``: the pre-pass did not run, so the
validate-before-HITL contract is broken and there is no validated command to
dispatch.

Both guards are deliberately an explicit ``raise`` rather than an ``assert``.
``assert`` is stripped under ``python -O`` / ``PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1``, which would
turn the guard into a no-op on exactly the interpreters a production deployment
is most likely to run. :class:`TestTheAssertStrippingPremise` measures that
stripping, so the choice is a pinned property rather than a comment.

Neither guard had a test. Both are second-line: on today's code the pre-pass
either sets the sentinel or returns an error, so nothing reaches a handler with
it unset and a coverage report shows both raise bodies dead. They exist for the
refactor that changes that -- and the measured cost of losing one is not a tidy
failure. With the ``broadcast`` guard deleted and ``validate_command`` returning
``None`` (a validator refactored to validate in place), the handler calls
``mesh.broadcast(None, timeout=30.0)``: a fleet-wide dispatch of a non-command
leaves the tool, and the ``AttributeError`` that follows lands on the audit line
*after* the dispatch, so the dispatch is never recorded. The ``send`` half is the
same against a single targeted peer.

The guards raise rather than returning the tool's structured error envelope on
purpose: an unset sentinel is a broken internal contract, not a malformed agent
tool call, so there is no caller mistake to report and failing loudly is the
fail-closed answer. The structured-error contract for malformed *input* is
pinned separately.

Reaching a guard needs the refactor its comment names, modelled here by pointing
``validate_command`` at a validator that returns ``None`` instead of the
sanitised copy. That leaves the pre-pass succeeding with the sentinel unset --
exactly the state the guard exists to catch.
