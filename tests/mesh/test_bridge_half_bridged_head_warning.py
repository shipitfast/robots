"""A topic in the exact-match bridge list whose per-turn tails are not bridged warns once.

``STRANDS_MESH_BRIDGE_TOPICS`` is an exact-match list and
``STRANDS_MESH_BRIDGE_TOPICS_PREFIX`` a prefix list. An operator who adds a
head to the first and then sees ``<head>/<turn>`` traffic gets the bare topic
on MQTT and every per-turn message left on the LAN -- a change that looks like
it took while half of it silently did not. ``_should_bridge`` must still refuse
the tail (that is the documented contract) and say so, once per head, so the
misconfiguration is visible rather than a silent partial success.
