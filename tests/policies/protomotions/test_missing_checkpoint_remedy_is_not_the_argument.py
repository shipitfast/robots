"""The missing-checkpoint refusal must name a step, not the caller's argument.

``ProtoMotionsPolicy`` takes ``onnx_path`` as a *local* file and resolves no
HuggingFace model id - unlike ``WBCPolicy``, whose ``checkpoint`` is downloaded
through ``huggingface_hub``. The ``[protomotions]`` extra declares that hub
client all the same, and the install docs used to attribute the fetch to it, so
the documented next step for a reader was to pass the model id.

Doing that produced::

    ONNX artifact not found: cagataydev/protomotions-gtp-unitree-g1. Download
    from cagataydev/protomotions-gtp-unitree-g1 on HuggingFace.

- a remedy that names the argument back. The caller is told to download the
string they just supplied, with no step that turns it into the local path the
parameter wants. These cells pin the refusal on the step instead: the canonical
repo *and* file name, as a command whose output is the path to pass.

The value-domain cells for this constructor live in
``test_history_length_sizes_the_window_it_names.py``; this file grades only the
not-found remedy and the install sentence that sends a reader into it.
