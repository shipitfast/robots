"""``rtc_max_guidance_weight`` reaches the field lerobot reads, or is refused.

lerobot's RTC denoiser takes the guidance ceiling from
``self.rtc_config.max_guidance_weight`` - it clamps with
``torch.minimum(guidance_weight, max_guidance_weight)`` and feeds the same value
to ``nan_to_num(..., posinf=max_guidance_weight)``. It is *not* part of the RTC
kwarg contract - the ``TypedDict`` ``predict_action_chunk`` unpacks, which
carries ``inference_delay``, ``prev_chunk_left_over`` and ``execution_horizon``
and nothing else.

So a ceiling kept only on the policy object cannot take effect. Pre-fix
``_init_rtc`` read the checkpoint's value as a *default* into
``self._rtc_max_guidance_weight`` and never wrote a caller's override back, so
the override reached one ``logger.info`` line and nothing else: a caller asking
for ``2.0`` ran the model's own ``10.0``. Its adjacent twin
``rtc_execution_horizon`` did take effect, because that one IS a kwarg and
``_predict_with_rtc`` forwards it per call.

The value also had no domain, while every numeric sibling in the same
constructor has one - so ``0``, ``-5.0``, ``nan``, ``inf``, ``True`` and
``"abc"`` were all accepted. ``0`` and a negative are values lerobot's own
``RTCConfig.__post_init__`` refuses outright ("max_guidance_weight must be
positive"); that constructor never sees this one, because the override is
written onto an already-built config, so the domain is asked at the seam the
caller names instead.

Why the suite was green over it: ``test_rtc_user_overrides_config_values`` is
named for both knobs overriding the config and asserts only that
``policy._rtc_max_guidance_weight`` keeps the value it was given - an attribute
round-trip, which held either way. ``TestRTCConfigSchemaContract`` pins that
lerobot still *exposes* the field, i.e. it grades the read and never the
application.
