"""The inert-normalization remedy covers units, not just stats.

A base checkpoint's stats are inert because they are keyed by the training
dataset, and the load-time diagnostic prescribes ``processor_overrides`` to
supply them. Those stats are in the units the dataset was RECORDED in: an SO-arm
dataset comes through the driver's ``MotorNormMode`` (arm joints in servo
degrees, gripper in ``RANGE_0_100``), while a MuJoCo state is radians. So the
stats half alone is not a remedy for a sim caller - it rescales nothing, the
sim's whole joint range lands inside a fraction of one standard deviation, and
``observation.state`` reaches the model as a near-constant.

These tests pin both ends of that: the arithmetic that makes the unit half
load-bearing, and the diagnostic plus the docs remedy naming it.
