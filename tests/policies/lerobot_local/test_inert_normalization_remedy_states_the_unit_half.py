"""The inert-normalization remedy covers units, not just stats.

A base checkpoint's stats are inert because they are keyed by the training
dataset, and the load-time diagnostic prescribes ``processor_overrides`` to
supply them. Those stats are in the units the dataset was RECORDED in: an SO-arm
dataset comes through the driver's ``MotorNormMode`` (arm joints in servo
degrees, gripper in ``RANGE_0_100``), while a MuJoCo state is radians. So the
stats half alone is not a remedy for a sim caller - it rescales nothing, the
sim's whole joint range lands inside a fraction of one standard deviation, and
``observation.state`` reaches the model as a near-constant.

And the reverse pairing is not a degraded remedy but a broken one: a declared
embodiment whose ``state_units``/``action_units`` are not native writes its
conversion into the tensor the inert normalizer then leaves alone, so the
converted value reaches the model unscaled. The load path refuses that
combination instead of prescribing the unit half a caller already declared.

These tests pin all three ends: the arithmetic that makes the unit half
load-bearing, the diagnostic plus the docs remedy naming it, and the refusal of
a unit-converting embodiment whose stats are inert.
