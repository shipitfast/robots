    ``examples/01_sim_hello_world.py`` printed three clamp warnings before its
    one line of expected output, because the mock's ±0.5 sinusoid did not fit
    the SO-100 ``Pitch`` / ``Jaw`` / ``Elbow`` ranges. The engine hands an
    opted-in policy the model through ``set_sim_context``; the mock uses it to
    clip.

    Both shipped SO arms are rolled out because MuJoCo holds a command to a
    range two ways and each arm is one of them: so100's MJCF sets
    ``inheritrange="1"`` so every actuator compiles a ``ctrlrange``, while
    so101 authors neither attribute, so its six actuators are unlimited
    position servos whose ``ctrl`` is bounded by the driven joint's own limits.
    A mock that reads only ``actuator_ctrllimited`` learns nothing on so101 and
    commands its jaw past ``-0.1745``.
