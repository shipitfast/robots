r"""A value read out of a live observation cannot split the record that quotes it.

Eight ``py/log-injection`` alerts are open across three policy providers and
issue #2853 has the census. What the alerts agree on is the taint path: an
observation dict's own key names, a camera key, a language instruction and a
joint-state object all reach a logging sink. What they do not distinguish is
whether the value can still carry a ``\r`` or ``\n`` *by the time it is
interpolated* - and that is the only thing that splits a record for a
line-oriented consumer, which is the defect the rule is named for.

Measured on the tree before this module existed, driving each sink with a payload
whose name carried a line feed:

===== ================================= ==============================================
alert sink                              raw break in ``LogRecord.getMessage()``
===== ================================= ==============================================
715   ``_to_lerobot_observation``       yes - bare ``%s`` on the camera key
716   ``_build_observation_batch``      yes - bare ``%s`` on the instruction slice
717   ``_resolve_camera_targets``       yes - bare ``%s`` on the camera name
949   ``_resolve_state_order``          no - the keys arrive inside a list, and
                                        ``repr`` escapes a ``str`` element
714   ``_collect_state_values``         no - same list interpolation
710   ``_apply_world_update``           no - ``%r`` over a list of keys
711   cuRobo ``_extract_joint_state``   no - ``tolist()`` runs before the sink, so
                                        ``%r`` renders a list
712   MoveIt2 ``_extract_joint_state``  no - same
===== ================================= ==============================================

So three of the eight could forge a record and five could not. The five are not
safe *by construction* though - they are safe by the shape the value happens to
arrive in. Interpolate the same keys as ``', '.join(scalar_keys)`` for
readability, or hand ``%r`` a list holding one object with a multi-line
``__repr__`` instead of a list of strings, and the property is gone with nothing
at the sink to notice. That last case is not hypothetical: it is what cells
:func:`test_curobo_joint_state_object_with_a_multiline_repr_cannot_split_the_record`
and its MoveIt2 sibling drive, and both fail on the pre-change tree.

Hence the grading here is split in three, and each cell says which kind it is:

* **Forging cells** - drive a sink with a payload that *did* split the record
  before, and pin that it no longer does. These fail on the pre-change tree.
* **Property cells** - drive a sink whose escape was incidental, and pin the
  property directly so it is stated at the sink rather than inferred from the
  caller's formatting choice. These pass either way; what they defend is the
  next refactor of the message, not this change.
* **The wiring cell** - hold the set of sanitized sinks to exactly the eight the
  census names, keyed by the function that owns each one because a line number is
  the part that goes stale. Removing a wrapper fails it. Finding a *new* sink is
  CodeQL's job, not this file's.
