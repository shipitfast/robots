"""``build_observation`` refuses a non-finite component instead of feeding it to the graph.

#2887 held the two floating-base blocks to a width, and a width was the only
thing the builder held anything to. Every value it reads - the two base blocks,
the ``len(joint_names)`` position and velocity scalars, the previous action and
the command - reached the vector the ONNX graph consumes without anyone asking
whether it was a number.

Measured on the pre-fix tree with the shipped alpha command width (C=13, so the
documented return width is ``48 + 13 == 61``):

============================  =========  ==========================================
caller input                  outcome    what reached the graph
============================  =========  ==========================================
contract (control)            success    61 finite components
``base_quat`` has a ``nan``   success    3 non-finite (the whole gravity block)
``base_ang_vel`` has a ``nan``  success  1 non-finite
a joint position is ``nan``   success    1 non-finite
a joint velocity is ``nan``   success    1 non-finite
``last_action`` has a ``nan``   success  1 non-finite
``command`` has a ``nan``     success    1 non-finite
============================  =========  ==========================================

Every row reported success at the documented width, which is what makes the
failure hard to attribute: a ``nan`` observation is shaped exactly like a healthy
one. What happens next depends on the checkpoint. A graph that tolerates the
value answers with a number nobody can trace, and a graph that propagates it -
which is what any real one does - hands back a ``nan`` action that
``get_actions``' own finiteness guard (#2882) then refuses **as** ``'the ONNX
action'``:

    MicroduckPolicy.get_actions: 'the ONNX action' must contain finite numbers
    (no nan/inf), got array([nan, ...], dtype=float32)

So the caller was told the checkpoint's graph produced a bad action, for a
``nan`` the caller's own observation dict supplied. That is the same
misattribution shape as an IK solve refusing ``target_pose`` for a seed the
caller never named (#2879).

The guard runs on the ASSEMBLED vector, once, because that is the single place
every input path meets. It is a plain :func:`numpy.isfinite` rather than
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.finite_vector_error` for a measured reason: at that
point the value is a ``float32`` 1-D array the builder itself made, so none of
the spellings the shared domain exists to judge can reach it, the two agree on
everything that can, and the shared domain costs more than the whole build
(40.68 us against a 37.92 us build, where the ``isfinite`` pass costs 1.27 us).
``TestTheSharedDomainWouldAgreeHere`` pins the agreement so the equivalence is
measured rather than assumed.

The rule this states - a caller-supplied vector is held to both width and
finiteness at the entry that received it - is the convention
``WBCPolicy._validate_velocity`` applies to the same well-known goal key. This
package refused a non-finite vector on the graph's OUTPUT and not on the caller's
INPUT.
