"""The servo tools put the codec's frames on the wire, and read its sign.

``strands_robots.drivers.feetech.protocol`` owns this wire format. The two tools
that drive a Feetech bus each carried a ``build_feetech_packet`` of their own -
six lines assembling ``FF FF ID LEN INST <params> CHK`` and spelling the
register address as a hex literal at each call site - so the package held three
copies of the format and three chances to disagree with it.

They did disagree, in the half that is not the frame. ``Present_Position``
(0x38) is sign-magnitude on the STS/SMS series: bit 15 is the direction. The
driver's bus reads it that way; the pose tool decoded the whole field as a
magnitude, so a servo reporting a joint just past its homing zero was quoted as
a position more than a full turn away:

===========  ==========  ==================  =================
wire word    counts      reported before     reported after
===========  ==========  ==================  =================
``0x0800``   2048        0.04 deg            0.04 deg
``0x8001``   -1          **2700.79 deg**     -180.09 deg
``0x8064``   -100        **2709.49 deg**     -188.79 deg
``0x8320``   -800        **2771.03 deg**     -250.33 deg
===========  ==========  ==================  =================

``shoulder_pan`` spans -180..180 degrees, so every emboldened number is one the
joint cannot hold, reported as a measurement. The bit is not this suite's
invention: ``tests/drivers/test_feetech_position_carries_a_sign.py`` grades
:data:`~strands_robots.drivers.feetech.protocol.SIGN_BIT` against lerobot's
``STS_SMS_SERIES_ENCODINGS_TABLE`` and the vendor SDK, and one cell here pins
the entry this tool now reads.

The frames are the control: byte for byte the same as before, which is what
makes the sign the only behaviour that moved.
