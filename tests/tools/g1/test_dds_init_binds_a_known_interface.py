"""ensure_dds records the interface it bound, not the one it was asked for.

The G1 DDS helper's first stated requirement is that
``ChannelFactoryInitialize`` runs "exactly once per process, with a known
network interface", and it keeps a module-level record of that interface so a
later caller asking for a different one is refused rather than silently
re-bound onto the wrong NIC.

The record is only worth refusing on if it is true. ``ChannelFactory.Init``
short-circuits on ``if __initialized: return True`` and never looks at its
``networkInterface`` argument, so a second ``ChannelFactoryInitialize`` returns
normally without binding anything - a no-op that is indistinguishable, at the
call site, from a successful bind. A process where anything else brought the
bus up first therefore had ``ensure_dds`` report success and record an
interface the bus was never on, and a later refusal then quoted that
fabricated interface back at the caller.

Every cell here drives a fake ``unitree_sdk2py.core.channel``: binding the
real factory is a process-wide side effect with no ``Shutdown``, so a suite
that did it once would change what every later test observes.
:class:`TestTheRealSdkBehavesTheWayTheDoubleDoes` pins the double against the
installed SDK so it cannot drift into agreeing with a bug, and skips when the
SDK is absent (Thor, CI) rather than passing vacuously.
