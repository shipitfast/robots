"""A teardown racing a subscribe/publish leaves no live endpoint behind.

:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.unitree._dds_engine.DDSSubscriberSet.close` and
:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.unitree._dds_engine.DDSPublisher.close` swap their
collection out under ``_lock`` and then release what they took.
:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.unitree._dds_engine.DDSSubscriberSet.subscribe` and
:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.unitree._dds_engine.DDSPublisher.get_publisher` build
their endpoint under ``_DDS_INIT_LOCK`` - a different lock, held for the whole
construction because the CycloneDDS bindings segfault on concurrent
construction.

Those two locks do not exclude each other, so a teardown can complete between
the moment a construction finishes and the moment it records what it built.
Recording into the fresh collection then puts a live endpoint somewhere
``close`` has already walked past. Nothing reaches it afterwards:
:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.g1.G1Driver.cleanup` drops the set right after
closing it, so the second ``close`` that would collect the orphan never
happens.

What is left behind is the state the engine's own ``close`` docstring describes
at length: ``subscribe`` asks for ``queueLen=10``, and at any queue length
above zero ``unitree_sdk2py`` starts a ``ch_reader`` daemon thread whose target
is a bound method of the channel's reader, so the reader stays matched and the
decoder callback keeps filling caches for a driver that believes it is
disconnected. :func:`~strands_robots.drivers.unitree._dds_engine._release_partial`
already exists to uphold exactly this invariant on the path where construction
*fails*; these cells grade it on the path where construction succeeds and the
recording is what could not happen.

The interleaving is driven deterministically: the stand-in's ``Init`` blocks
after signalling, which parks the caller inside ``_DDS_INIT_LOCK`` holding a
fully built endpoint, and the teardown then runs to completion. No sleeps, no
DDS bus, and no SDK - the stand-ins are what the production path constructs.
