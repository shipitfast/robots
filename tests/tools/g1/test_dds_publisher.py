"""DDSPublisher: the write half of the G1 DDS engine.

Every SDK touch is mocked. The subscriber set's tests already pin the
read path against the shared lock and lazy-import invariants; this suite
pins the write path against the *same* invariants, so a future change that
loosens either half of the engine fails here and there together.

No G1 hardware, no ``unitree_sdk2py`` on this box - the SDK's ``ChannelPublisher``
is injected into the module namespace under a monkeypatch, then the real
lazy import is restored. That is the shape the module invites: a module-level
``import unitree_sdk2py`` would fail on Thor and CI, so the tests must exercise
the lazy path rather than the cached one.
