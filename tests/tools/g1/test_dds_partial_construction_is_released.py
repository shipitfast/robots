"""A DDS endpoint whose construction failed part way is closed, not dropped.

:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.unitree._dds_engine.DDSSubscriberSet.subscribe` and
:meth:`~strands_robots.drivers.unitree._dds_engine.DDSPublisher.get_publisher` each
build an SDK endpoint in two steps - construct, then ``Init`` - and report a
named reason if either step raises. Neither step is atomic, and the endpoint
that failed holds real DDS state: ``ChannelSubscriber.__init__`` creates a live
``Channel`` before ``Init`` runs, and ``unitree_sdk2py`` starts the
``ch_reader`` daemon thread *before* it constructs the ``DataReader`` that can
raise.

Returning the reason and dropping the endpoint therefore leaks exactly what
``close`` exists to release, and it leaks it where ``close`` can never reach:
the failing call never appended to ``_subs`` or wrote to ``_pubs``, so the
driver's teardown walks a collection the half-built endpoint is not in. The
engine's own ``close`` docstrings spell out why a dropped reference is not a
release - the reader thread keeps the channel reachable, so no finaliser runs.

The behavioural cells drive recording stand-ins, so they grade the production
path on a box with no SDK. The facts a stand-in cannot establish - that a
partial ``Init`` really leaves a live thread, and that ``Close()`` really
releases it - are driven against the installed SDK and skip where it is
absent. They need no DDS bus: the reader is constructed directly and the
``DataReader`` it would build is the injected fault, so nothing here
initialises the process-wide channel factory.
