"""A pose_tool motion or serial_tool write its own branch would refuse is refused before the operator is asked.

Both tools ask the operator to approve every motion/write, then check what
they were given. ``move_motor`` without a position, ``load_pose`` of a pose
that is not stored, ``send`` with no payload or with ``hex_data="ZZ"``:
each raised the approval interrupt, and the operator who typed "y" was
answered with ``motor_name and position required`` or, for the bad hex, a
``ValueError`` from the write after the port was opened. Those checks now
run first; the branches still run them again.
