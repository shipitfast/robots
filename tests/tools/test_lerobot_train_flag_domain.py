"""``lerobot_train`` must refuse a training posture it can only misread.

Each of the five booleans this argv is built from selects a *posture*, not a
magnitude, and each was read by truthiness - so the words a caller reaches for
when opting out selected the affirmative posture, because every non-empty string
is truthy. Measured on ``12dc48d`` with ``policy_type="act"`` unless noted:

* ``resume="false"`` built ``--config_path=<ckpt> --resume=true`` and returned,
  so the fresh run that was asked for became a resume of a previous config and
  ``--policy.device``, ``--steps``, ``--batch_size`` and ``--save_freq`` were all
  silently dropped from the argv;
* ``lora="false"`` emitted ``--peft.method_type=LORA``;
* ``gradient_checkpointing="false"`` on ``pi0`` emitted
  ``--policy.gradient_checkpointing=true``;
* ``push_to_hub="no"`` emitted ``--policy.push_to_hub=no``.

The other three answered with a refusal whose remedy the caller had already
followed, which cannot be acted on at all: ``lora="false",
train_expert_only="false"`` raised "Pick one fine-tuning strategy" at a caller
who picked neither, ``train_expert_only="false"`` raised "only valid for ['pi0',
'pi05', 'smolvla'] policies", and ``gradient_checkpointing="false"`` on ``act``
raised "drop gradient_checkpointing=" at a caller who had spelled exactly that.

Nothing reports the silent postures: the argv goes to a detached process, the
tool answers ``status="success"`` with a pid and a log path, and lerobot parses
each of those argvs without complaint - it is simply told the opposite posture.
That is the reason the run-size numerics, ``device`` and ``save_freq`` in the
same argv are already refused up front
(``tests/tools/test_lerobot_train_size_knob_domain.py`` and siblings), and these
five are the postures beside them that were carried through unchecked.

The flags are held to the shared
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error` domain - the one the sibling
builder ``build_lerobot_command`` already applies to its own argv postures
(``tests/tools/test_lerobot_teleoperate_flag_domain.py``) - so a posture is
refused identically wherever it is supplied rather than merely equivalently.

Both surfaces that read the flags refuse them. The builder owns the argv, but is
reached too late for the tool's own reader: ``push_to_hub`` is consulted by the
operator approval gate first, so an opt-out asked a human to approve a Hub
publication nobody requested.
