"""A lazily-mapped tool name read off the tools package is not a module.

:mod:`strands_robots.tools` maps each tool name to the ``@tool`` object living
inside the submodule of the *same* name, and caches the result into the package
namespace::

    "pose_tool": (".pose_tool", "pose_tool"),

So ``from strands_robots.tools import pose_tool`` has two possible resolutions,
decided by which import ran first anywhere in the process. CPython's
``_handle_fromlist`` imports the submodule only when the attribute is *absent*;
here the lookup triggers the package ``__getattr__``, which succeeds, so the
submodule is never imported and the name binds to the tool object instead.

The two are not interchangeable. A ``DecoratedFunctionTool`` carries no
``__file__``, no ``__spec__``, and none of the module's private names, so a
source that binds a name this way and then reads it as a module passes or fails
on the import order of the whole process rather than on the behavior it is
about. The failure surfaces as ``AttributeError`` naming the attribute, which
points at the read rather than at the import that decided it.

Both halves of the rule are derived, so a tool added to the mapping and a call
site added to any scanned tree are graded on arrival:

- which names are ambiguous at all - a mapped name that is also a submodule;
- which attributes only a module can answer - asked of the tool object itself,
  rather than listed here, because that list is what drifts.

The sweep over this project's own sources is a regression tripwire: it holds no
grading power of its own once the last ambiguous read is gone, because there is
then nothing for it to classify. The power lives in
:class:`TestTheRuleFlagsTheReadItIsFor`, which runs the same predicate over
constructed sources covering both outcomes.
