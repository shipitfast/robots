"""A session store that cannot be written keeps the sessions it already held.

Both session tools persist a whole document to the same file: ``add_session``
and ``remove_session`` load every record, change one entry, and store the map
back. Encoding that document straight into its own destination made a rejected
write destructive - the stream is truncated first, so a full disk left a prefix
where the store was, and both load paths report an unparseable store as *no
sessions*.

The records in that file are the only place a detached process's pid is written
down, which ``SessionManager`` says out loud: it "never deletes one" because of
it, and its load path keeps a record it could not inspect "so the session stays
stoppable". One failed write dropped all of them at once, so three live
processes - one of them a teleoperation loop driving a follower arm - kept
running while ``list`` answered ``status="success"`` with no sessions and
``stop`` answered that the session was not found.

These cells pin the commit instead: the document is serialized before the
destination is touched, committed through a temp file plus ``os.replace``, and a
failed write leaves every session already recorded stored, listed and stoppable.
