"""Shared serial-layer doubles for the ``pose_tool`` test modules.

These live in a conftest rather than in one test module because several
modules now need them, and importing a fixture across test modules re-binds
the name in the importing module (ruff F811) as well as making the owning
module an implicit dependency of the other.

The doubles stand in for ``serial.Serial``, so the fixtures take pyserial at
fixture time rather than importing it here: pyserial reaches the tree only
through ``strands-robots[lerobot]``, and a conftest is loaded before anything in
its directory is collected, so one module-scope import of it would cost the
whole directory (``ImportError while loading conftest``, exit 4) on an install
without that extra.

``pose_tool``'s ``port`` defaults to ``/dev/ttyACM0`` and several actions --
``emergency_stop`` above all -- write to the bus, so every test that reaches
the motor path must both take ``fake_serial`` and pass an explicit fake
``port``. Otherwise the suite drives whatever arm is plugged into the machine
running it.
