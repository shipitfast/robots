"""The session store must not delete the record of a live process.

One store holds every detached robot session: ``lerobot_train`` and
``lerobot_teleoperate`` both start their runs with ``start_new_session=True`` and
write the pid into the same JSON document, read and written by the one
:class:`~strands_robots.tools._process_stop.SessionManager`. It is the only place
that pid is recorded, and ``list``, ``status`` and ``stop`` all look the session
up there. So what the load step chooses to leave out is load-bearing, and it is
load-bearing twice over, because ``add_session`` and ``remove_session`` are
load-modify-write - a record the load omits is erased from disk by the next
session started or stopped, after which the process holds the GPU or goes on
driving the arm with no supported way left to stop it.

That is also why the store cannot hold two retention policies. A read that
prunes prunes for every tool reading the same document, so the destructive policy
is the one that takes effect: measured before this rule reached one owner, three
records the training tool documented itself as keeping were erased from disk by
one teleoperation ``list``, and the same process logged "its record is kept" and
"dropping the record" about the same record.

Leaving a record out is not needed to avoid over-reporting it either: presence in
the store is not the running claim. ``list`` and ``status`` each derive that from
:func:`~strands_robots.tools._process_stop.session_is_running` at the moment they
are asked, so a retained record reads as running only while its pid *still holds
the process the record was written for*. Both halves of that are pinned below as
controls: a pid that is gone, and a pid that another process now holds.

The load path takes two probes of its own, and neither is that verdict.
``psutil.pid_exists`` answers existence with a signal; ``Process(pid).is_running()``
reads the process, and ``_report_uninspectable`` calls it for what it raises
rather than for what it returns. No outcome of either is grounds for deleting the
record:

* ``pid_exists`` False - the run finished. Kept, so ``status`` can still report
  the final log tail.
* an identity the pid no longer reports - the run finished and the number was
  handed out again. The same finished run as the row above, reached through the
  identity comparison rather than through existence.
* ``NoSuchProcess`` - reaped between the two probes. Also the same finished run,
  and which of these paths a finished run takes is a race, so they must not be
  classified differently.
* ``AccessDenied`` - the process exists and this user may not inspect it; a
  session started under ``sudo`` for device access and later listed as the
  invoking user reads this way. That is not death, and it is the one case where
  dropping the record loses a pid that still names a *live* process.

No case below poses ``is_running()`` answering ``False``, because that call
cannot: a freshly constructed :class:`psutil.Process` captures the identity it is
about to be asked about, so on the locked psutil it answers ``True`` or raises
:class:`~psutil.NoSuchProcess`, and the load path constructs one per read. Only an
object built before the exit and read after it returns ``False``. The stand-ins
below therefore refuse the probe rather than answering it.

Deletion still happens, on request: ``remove_session`` is the one thing that
drops a record, and a ``stop`` that reaches its process removes it. Retention is
about classification, not about a store that can never shrink.
