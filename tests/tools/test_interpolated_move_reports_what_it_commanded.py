"""An interpolated pose move must answer for the joints it actually commanded.

``MotorController._smooth_move`` ended with a literal ``return True`` and threw
away every ``move_motor`` result, so the interpolating path reported success no
matter what reached the bus. Two things it did silently:

* A motor whose current position did not arrive has no start point, so no
  trajectory is built for it and it is never commanded. It was dropped from the
  move without a word.
* A write that raised - a pulled cable, a bus held by another process - was
  logged by ``move_motor`` and then discarded by the loop.

On an identical bus the sibling one flag away told the truth:
``move_multiple_motors(smooth=False)`` reads every ``move_motor`` outcome. So a
single ``smooth`` flag selected between two contracts, and ``smooth`` defaults
to ``True`` - the default path was the lying one. ``reset_to_home`` passes
``smooth=True`` itself and cannot opt out at all.

The tests assert against the BYTES that reach the bus rather than the status
text, for the reason the sibling emergency-stop module gives: the wording was
already right, and only the packets say whether the arm moved.

No real serial port is opened: ``serial.Serial`` is replaced and every call
passes an explicit fake ``port`` -- ``pose_tool``'s ``port`` defaults to
``/dev/ttyACM0``, so a portless call would drive an arm plugged into the machine
running the suite.
