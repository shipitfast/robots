"""Behavior tests for the ``strands_robots.tools`` lazy-import contract.

The tools package defers importing each tool module until first attribute
access so that ``import strands_robots.tools`` never pulls in numpy, pyserial,
psutil, and the other heavy per-tool dependencies. These tests pin that public
contract:

- Every name advertised in ``__all__`` is lazily importable as a real attribute.
- The first access materializes the tool via ``__getattr__`` and caches it into
  the package namespace, so a repeat access returns the identical object.
- An unknown attribute raises ``AttributeError`` naming the package and the
  missing attribute, matching the standard module-level ``__getattr__`` protocol.
- Materializing a tool has no effect on the host process: reaching one is an
  import, and an import must not configure logging or write to the filesystem.

That last one needs the lazy table to be graded at the right point. Because the
table defers each module, ``import strands_robots.tools`` runs no tool module at
all, so asserting *that* import is side-effect-free passes without grading
anything. The side effect lands on the first attribute access - the documented
way in (``from strands_robots.tools import <tool>`` resolves through
``__getattr__``) - so the population graded here is the tool modules themselves.

    """A tool module runs at first attribute access, so its top level is an import.

    Reaching a tool is not a call. ``from strands_robots.tools import pose_tool``
    executes that module's top level in whatever process imported it, which may
    be an agent, a notebook, or another library's test suite. Two top-level
    statements are therefore not available to a tool module even though they run
    fine in a script:

    ``logging.basicConfig()`` configures the *root* logger, so a library calling
    it takes over the host application's logging - installing a stderr handler
    and, with ``level=``, lowering the root level for every logger in the
    process. The module needs ``logging.getLogger(__name__)``, which configures
    nothing, and leaves the choice of handlers to whoever runs the program.

    The module-level ``logging.debug()`` / ``.info()`` / ``.warning()`` helpers
    are refused for the same reason and are the easier one to reach by accident:
    each calls ``basicConfig()`` itself when the root logger has no handler, so
    logging one line at import installs the handler without naming it. LeRobot
    does exactly this - ``lerobot.utils.import_utils`` probes its optional
    dependencies at import and reports each with ``logging.debug()``, which is
    why importing ``lerobot.cameras`` installs a root stderr handler. Only calls
    on a named logger are import-safe.

    ``mkdir()`` at the top level writes to the filesystem for an import that may
    never call the tool. The one session store below does it under
    ``Path.cwd()``, so merely reading a tool's help litters the directory the
    process happens to be in; it is named here rather than fixed because its
    contents are load-bearing session state, and moving it is a behaviour change
    this contract does not make. A *second* one is refused - which is what a
    tool defining its own copy of the store path would be.

    Graded with ``ast``, not by importing, so each offender is attributed to its
    own module: ``basicConfig`` is a no-op once any handler exists, so the second
    module to call it looks clean at runtime.
