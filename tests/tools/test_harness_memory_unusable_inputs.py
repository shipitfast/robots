"""Every branch of ``harness_memory`` that reports an unusable input or store.

The module has five such branches, and together they were its entire uncovered
set: four refuse and one degrades.

* the action vocabulary cannot be read -- the simulation tool spec is present
  but does not carry an ``action`` enum (``get_valid_actions``);
* a trace entry cannot be serialized (``_validate_trace``);
* a summary cannot be serialized (``_validate_summary``);
* the distribution metadata is absent, so trace provenance records an unknown
  version instead of failing the save (``_version_string``) -- the one
  degradation rather than a refusal;
* a global-rule store is not valid UTF-8 (``HarnessMemory._read_rules``);
* a global-rule store holds a line the write path would refuse -- over
  ``_MAX_RULE_CHARS``, carrying control characters, or more than
  ``_MAX_RULES_PER_KIND`` lines (``HarnessMemory._read_rules``). A rule store
  is read straight into planner context, so the load is held to the bounds
  ``append_rule`` enforces rather than echoing whatever is on disk.

Each one is a documented contract that nothing exercised. The two that reach a
caller through :class:`HarnessMemory` rather than through the tool -- an
unreadable store seen from ``load_rules`` and from ``append_rule`` -- had no
``Raises:`` entry at all, so their all-or-nothing read was undocumented as well
as unpinned; this module pins the behaviour those entries now describe.

The tool converts all four refusals into the ``{"status": "error"}`` envelope
rather than raising, so both the library-level reason and the tool-level report
are asserted: the reason has to name the input or the file, because the remedy
is to repair the thing it names.
