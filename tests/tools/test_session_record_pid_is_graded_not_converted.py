"""A session record's pid is graded, not converted into a nearby process id.

Both session tools keep their sessions in a JSON file, and every verb that
reports on or stops one starts by reading a ``pid`` out of it. That value is a
file's declaration rather than a caller's argument, and converting it is how a
record comes to name a process it was never written for: ``int(4321.5)`` is
``4321``, and ``bool`` is an ``int`` subclass, so ``true`` is pid 1 - ``init`` on
Linux. Measured before the fix these tests pin, a store whose ``pid`` field held
``true`` read as a live session and ``stop`` handed ``os.kill`` pid 1, while a
record spelling a live stranger's pid with ``.5`` after it got that stranger
killed and reported success naming a number that is not a pid.

The same conversion is the other way a record goes wrong. ``int()`` raises for
values ``json.load`` produces from a well-formed file - ``ValueError`` for a
string carrying the U+FFFD the store's own decode policy substitutes for a
damaged byte, ``OverflowError`` for ``1e400``, ``ValueError`` for ``NaN`` - and
neither store's read handles either, so a read documented to degrade to "no
sessions" aborted the action that asked instead.

:func:`~strands_robots.tools._process_stop.recorded_pid` is the one reader of
that field for both tools, in the shape
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.declared_count` uses for a count a file declares:
the pid, or ``None`` for no usable one. These tests pin the domain, that no
spelling raises anywhere, that nothing outside it is ever signalled, and that
the one spelling a writer produces still stops its session.
