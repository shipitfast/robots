"""A session's running verdict must name the process the record was written for.

``lerobot_train`` and ``lerobot_teleoperate`` run their work detached and write
the pid to an on-disk store that outlives the run that made it. A pid is not a
name: the kernel hands the number back out once the process holding it exits, so
a record that outlives its run points at whatever holds the number next. Both
tools answered "is it running" from ``psutil.pid_exists`` alone, which is a
question about the *number*, so a reused pid read as the session still running -
and ``stop`` acted on that verdict by sending SIGTERM and then SIGKILL to a
process the session never started.

The reuse guard the tree believed it had was ``psutil.Process(pid).is_running()``.
It cannot be one when the object is constructed to ask the question: psutil
records the creation time at construction, so the object carries whatever the pid
means now and agrees with it. ``_process_stop.confirm_exit`` already states the
rule that closes this - the identity has to be captured *before* the question is
asked - and these records captured none, so there was nothing to compare against.

What is recorded now is the process's start offset since boot, which is a
duration and therefore the same number in the run that wrote it and the run that
reads it back hours later. A creation *date* would not be: it is the process's
start ticks plus ``/proc/stat``'s btime, so a correction between the write and the
read would make a live session read as a stranger - the one outcome worse than
this defect, because it would refuse to stop a training run that is holding the
GPU.

The offset is read from the kernel directly - ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` field 22 over
``SC_CLK_TCK`` - and *not* as ``create_time() - boot_time()``. That subtraction
looks like it recovers the ticks but puts the wall clock on both sides, and the
two terms are not guaranteed to be one read of it, so it moves under exactly the
step this identity exists to survive. The last two cells grade that: one pins
equality with the kernel's own value rather than a tolerance any spelling meets,
and one injects the skew and asserts a live session still reads as running.

A record carrying no identity, or one whose identity cannot be read, still falls
back to existence. Those are pinned below too: they are the reason this change
cannot strand a session, and they are the limit of the fix.
