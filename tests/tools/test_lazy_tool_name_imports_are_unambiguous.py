"""A lazily exported tool name is never read off the ``strands_robots.tools`` package.

The tools package maps each exported name to the ``@tool`` object inside the
submodule of the *same* name and caches the result in the package ``__dict__``.
Most of those names are also submodules, so the package attribute has two
possible values, and which one a read gets is decided by what the process
imported first:

===========================================  ======  ==================  ===============
spelling                                     cold    tool cached first   submodule first
===========================================  ======  ==================  ===============
``from strands_robots.tools import X``        tool    tool                module
``import strands_robots.tools.X as x``        module  tool                module
``importlib.import_module("...tools.X")``     module  module              module
``from strands_robots.tools.X import X``      tool    tool                tool
===========================================  ======  ==================  ===============

``from strands_robots.tools import X`` is the only spelling that writes the
*tool* into that slot: a submodule import writes the module, and the two bottom
rows never read or write it. So one such read anywhere in the process is what
makes the module-alias form order-dependent, and that form is what this tree
uses widely as a monkeypatch target - it then yields the tool, and the patch
target read raises ``AttributeError`` rather than naming an import-order
problem.

Both failure directions were live: two tests read the name and used the result
as a module (``AttributeError: 'DecoratedFunctionTool' object has no attribute
'__file__'``), and two examples read it and used the result as a tool
(``AttributeError: module ... has no attribute '__wrapped__'``). Each passed in
the selection it was written against and failed in another.

The remedy is per intent, and both remedies are immune by construction: read the
submodule when the module object is wanted, and read the tool off the submodule
when the tool is wanted. This guard bans the ambiguous read instead of grading
what each site does with the result, because the read is ambiguous whatever the
site intends.

The docs are held to the same rule, because a reader runs a fence in whatever
process they already have: ``from strands_robots import Robot`` - the first line
of nearly every page - imports ``strands_robots.mesh``, which imports the
``use_ros`` / ``use_rosbridge`` / ``use_rtps`` submodules, so the page's own
``from strands_robots.tools import use_ros`` then binds the module and
``use_ros(action=...)`` raises ``TypeError: 'module' object is not callable``.
A fence reads a tool off the package root (``from strands_robots import
use_ros``), whose lazy export has no same-named submodule to shadow it.

The complementary spelling - a plain ``tools.X`` attribute read - is graded,
within its own module, by
``tests/tools/test_tool_actions_block_names_the_dispatched_vocabulary.py``.
