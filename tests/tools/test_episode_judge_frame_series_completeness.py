"""An episode whose frames are not all readable is refused, not summarised.

:func:`strands_robots.tools.episode_judge.sample_frames` reports two motion
statistics its own docstring says the judge grades motion by: ``max_state_delta``
("for spotting discontinuities and teleports") and ``rms_state_jerk`` ("so a
text-only judge can ground ``jerky_motion`` from state alone"). Both are
computed over consecutive rows of the episode's frame series.

The reader behind them, ``_episode_frame_rows``, walked ``data/**/*.parquet``
and skipped any shard it could not read, with a comment saying the skip
"mirrors read_dataset_episode_indices". It does not.
:func:`strands_robots.verify_dataset.read_dataset_episode_indices` tolerates
an unreadable shard *and reports it* - it returns every damaged file in
``unreadable_files`` and its docstring states that "any non-empty
``unreadable_files`` means the totals are a lower bound and the dataset must
not be certified as complete". ``_episode_frame_rows`` took the tolerance
without the report, so the surviving rows were handed to the statistics as
though they were consecutive.

The consequence is fabricated evidence for exactly the failure modes the judge
grades. On a recording that moves a uniform 0.01 per step - no discontinuity
anywhere - losing one middle shard of three took ``max_state_delta`` from
0.010 to 0.070 and ``rms_state_jerk`` from 0.000 to 6123.7, reported as
``status="success"``. ``jerky_motion`` and ``drift`` are both in
:data:`strands_robots.episode_labels.FAILURE_MODES`, and ``write_label``
persists the judge's grade into the sidecar that filters training data, so a
truncated download - "the usual outcome of an interrupted sync or hub
download", in the sibling reader's own words - silently produces a wrong label
on a good episode.

It was also visible as two tools disagreeing: on the same dataset,
``load_episode`` (which reads the episode metadata) reported the true length
12 while ``sample_frames`` reported 6, both ``success``, neither naming a
dropped shard.

Covers:

* the refusal names the damaged shard, how many shards were damaged, and why a
  hole invalidates the summary;
* every damaged shard is named, not just the first one read;
* a fully unreadable episode reports the damage rather than "has no frames",
  which would name the wrong fault for frames that are present but unreadable;
* the two tools no longer disagree about the episode length - the one that
  cannot answer completely says so;
* the premise, measured on the fixture rather than assumed: the healthy series
  really is smooth, and the surviving rows really do read as a discontinuity;
* the controls that scope the refusal - a healthy dataset is unchanged, a
  parquet carrying no ``episode_index`` column is still skipped quietly (that
  is a non-frame table, not damage), and a dataset with no data parquet at all
  still reports the emptiness it always did.
