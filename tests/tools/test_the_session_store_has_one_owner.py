"""The detached-session store has one reader, so it has one retention policy.

``lerobot_train`` and ``lerobot_teleoperate`` keep their detached sessions in the
same JSON document under
:data:`~strands_robots.tools._process_stop.SESSION_DIR` - deliberately, so every
robot session lives together and either tool's ``list`` shows all of them. Each
tool used to define its own ``SessionManager`` over it, and the two disagreed
about what a read may delete: the training store's docstring said "no record is
dropped here, and that is what keeps a detached session stoppable", while the
teleoperation store pruned every record whose pid did not answer as running *and
wrote the pruned map back to disk*.

A document with two readers cannot hold two policies. Whichever reader deletes a
record deletes it for the other, so the destructive one is the one that takes
effect and the retaining one's guarantee was never the store's - only its own.
Measured on the two-class tree, one ``lerobot_teleoperate(action="list")`` erased
two of three records the training tool had just written and documented itself as
keeping, and the same process logged "its record is kept" and "dropping the
record" about the same record.

The suite could not see it, either: every test redirected one tool module's own
``SESSION_DIR``, so two independently-redirectable names for one file kept each
half isolated from the other. These cells drive both tools against ONE store, the
way production does, and pin that the class has one definition so a third copy
cannot reintroduce the disagreement.
