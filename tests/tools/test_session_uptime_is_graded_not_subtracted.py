"""A session record's start time is graded, not subtracted from the clock.

Both session tools keep their sessions in a JSON file, and ``list`` and
``status`` report each one's ``Uptime`` by subtracting the record's
``start_time`` from :func:`time.time`. That stamp is a file's declaration rather
than a caller's argument, and subtracting one that is not a stamp is how a
report comes to state a duration the session never had.

Measured against the code these tests pin, every spelling a session store can
hold other than a real stamp was reported wrongly, in one of three ways:

* A record with **no** ``start_time`` at all defaulted to ``0`` in the
  arithmetic, so ``time.time() - 0`` reported ``Uptime: 29813993.5 min``, a
  little under fifty-seven years, under ``status: success`` and beside a running
  flag that was right. ``true`` and ``0`` landed on the same answer.
* ``NaN`` reported ``Uptime: nan min``, ``Infinity`` reported ``-inf min``, and a
  stamp ahead of this clock - what a backwards NTP correction between the write
  and the read leaves behind - reported ``Uptime: -10.0 min``.
* ``null``, a ``str`` and a ``list`` raised out of the verb: ``list`` answered
  ``Tool execution failed: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and
  'NoneType'``, naming neither the session nor the field nor a remedy.

The two verbs of one tool also disagreed about one record, because they spelled
the same read differently - ``info.get("start_time", 0)`` in ``list`` against
``float(session_info.get("start_time") or 0)`` in ``status``. A store holding
``"1788000000"`` made ``list`` abort while ``status`` reported ``13993.5 min``,
nine and a half days, which is an entirely ordinary length for a training run.

The abort is the reach of it. A store holds every tracked session, and its own
load step is documented to degrade to empty rather than raise so that a record
damaged outside its pid still stops. One damaged ``start_time`` among three
records made ``list`` answer ``status: error`` and report **none** of them, so
two sessions that were genuinely running became invisible to the verb that
enumerates them.

:func:`~strands_robots.tools._process_stop.session_uptime` is the one reader of
that field for both tools, in the shape
:func:`~strands_robots.tools._process_stop.recorded_pid` uses for the ``pid``
beside it: the span, or ``None`` for no usable one, plus the sentence saying
which way the record did not state it. These tests pin the domain, that all four
surfaces reach the same verdict, that no spelling raises anywhere, that a
damaged record no longer hides its healthy neighbours, that the ``json`` block
carries no span the reader could not measure, and that a real stamp still
renders exactly as it did.
