"""Every guard in the package answers a value it cannot render, not only ``utils``'.

``strands_robots.utils`` established the rule: a guard's whole purpose is to
report a caller's bad value through a returned ``{status, content}`` result or a
refusal string, so building that answer must not raise. Rendering a value can
raise - ``repr`` of an ``int`` wider than :func:`sys.get_int_max_str_digits`
raises ``ValueError``, and :class:`numbers.Real` is a registration rather than an
inheritance, so a scalar that satisfies a guard's type test owes it nothing else.
:func:`~strands_robots.utils.refusal_repr` and its two siblings exist for that,
and ``tests/test_refusal_messages_never_raise.py`` pins them.

That scan read one file, and the same guard shape - a value annotated ``Any``
beside the ``str`` labels its call site supplies - is written in nineteen other
modules. Measured on ``4e73dc0f``, forty-three functions across twenty modules
interpolated the caller's value straight into their text, and **twenty-one of them
raised** when called with a value they had already decided to refuse:

| module | guards | raised |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``simulation/base.py`` | 8 | 5 |
| ``simulation/mujoco/physics.py`` | 3 | 3 |
| ``rendering/compositor.py`` | 5 | 5 |
| ``rendering/video.py`` | 4 | 3 |
| ``simulation/motion_primitives_base.py`` | 3 | 0 |
| ``tools/serial_tool.py`` | 3 | 2 |
| ... 14 more | 17 | 3 |

The other twenty-two offend the rule without this probe reaching them: they lead
with a ``utils`` guard, so a value refused on its *type* is answered by the shared
renderer before their own range branch renders anything. Their own branch is
reached by a value that passes the delegate and fails the range - which is
:class:`TestAStdlibFractionReachesTheRangeBranch`, and needs no third-party type
at all.

The structural half of this - that no guard in the package renders a caller value
directly - is stated over the package in
``tests/test_refusal_messages_never_raise.py``. What is pinned here is the
behaviour that rule is for: each module answers.
