"""A MuJoCo read that needs an offscreen GL context must be gated on the shared probe.

``Simulation.render`` returns ``{"status": "error"}`` on a host with no usable
offscreen GL context - headless without EGL/OSMesa - for a reason that has
nothing to do with whatever contract the calling test is pinning. Asserting
``render(...)["status"] == "success"`` inline therefore conflates the property
under test with a host graphics capability: it passes only where a GL context
happens to exist, and elsewhere it reports a bare ``'error' != 'success'`` that
names neither GL nor the contract.

Indexing a camera out of an observation is the same dependency in a second
spelling, and it degrades worse. ``get_observation`` renders each camera and
``_render_cameras`` logs a per-camera failure at debug level and *omits the key
it could not produce*, so ``get_observation(...)["camera1"]`` raises
``KeyError: 'camera1'`` - which names neither GL nor the contract nor even the
fact that a render was attempted. Both spellings are in scope here.

:mod:`tests.simulation.mujoco._gl_probe` exists for exactly this and is the
convention in its sibling modules. This guard keeps it the convention: every
GL-dependent read in a module that requires ``mujoco`` must sit behind that
probe, so a test added later cannot re-open the confusion.

Scope is the mujoco requirement, not a directory. A module that reads a rendered
value *without* requiring ``mujoco`` renders through some other backend,
whose availability the MuJoCo probe does not describe - ``tests/simulation/newton``
gates its own render tests on a Newton-availability marker instead. Keying on the
requirement rather than on a path excludes those by construction, so this rule
needs no exemption list.

Three gating forms are accepted, all of which stop the read from running without
a context: the probe's marker on the test function, the same marker on its
class, or an in-function ``gl_available()`` skip. All three are in use.

For the observation spelling the discriminator is the *key*, not the call. Sixteen
modules index an observation and the key names a camera in two of them; the other
fourteen read a joint angle or a base pose, or compute the key at runtime, and no
graphics context is involved in producing any of those. Keying on the call would
report seven such reads across five modules as needing a gate they do not need,
which is the shape of a rule contributors learn to route around. So a subscript
counts only when its key is a camera name the module itself registers - or the
free view every world registers - and only when the call did not ask to skip
images. A key computed at runtime is out of scope by construction, and both
boundaries are pinned below rather than left to be rediscovered.

The rule's own non-vacuity pin is keyed on modules, never on a count of
assertions: splitting one render call into its own gated case is what the remedy
below asks for, and must not move a number a contributor then has to chase.
