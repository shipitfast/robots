"""A provider whose module needs an absent dependency reports the dependency.

Three packages resolve a provider name to a class the same way, and each ends
its ladder with an auto-discovery rung that imports
``strands_robots.<package>.<provider>``. That import has two distinct failure
modes and they need distinct reports:

* the module does not exist - the provider name is unknown, and the caller wants
  the list of names that *are* known;
* the module exists but something IT imports is absent - the name was right and
  the caller wants the missing dependency.

Collapsing the second into the first sends a caller whose spelling was correct
to go and check the spelling. ``import_policy_class`` already separates them,
saying so in its own ``Raises:`` block; ``import_trainer_class`` caught ``ImportError`` and fell
through to ``No trainer registered for provider ... Available trainers: [...]``,
so a missing backend was reported as a name that does not exist.

The rule is graded over a DERIVED inventory rather than a list of two, because
the defect is what happens to the *next* resolver. A resolver is discovered
structurally: a function that hands :func:`importlib.import_module` an f-string
which begins ``strands_robots.`` and interpolates one of that function's own
parameters. That signature selects exactly the shipped two and nothing else,
and :class:`TestTheResolverInventoryIsDerived` pins that a third is picked up
on arrival - a hardcoded list equal to today's two would pass every case below
while grading nothing new.

Each resolver is then driven for real: a module is planted on the package's
``__path__`` whose body imports a package that is not installed, so the
production path runs against the exact ``ModuleNotFoundError`` the import system
raises. The assertions are deliberately disposition-agnostic - one resolver
re-raises and another wraps the error to add an install hint, and both satisfy
"reports the dependency" - so this file does not freeze either choice.
