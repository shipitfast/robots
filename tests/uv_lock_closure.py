"""Distributions an install of one extra resolves to, read from ``uv.lock``.

Several packaging rules ask the same question - does an install of this extra
really ship the dependency the manifest claims for it - and each answered it with
its own copy of the same walk. One owner, because a copy that drifts answers a
different question under the same name.

The walk reads the checked-in lock rather than resolving live, so a rule that
grades the manifest stays offline and deterministic. Markers are deliberately not
evaluated: the result is a superset of what any one platform installs, which is
the safe direction for a rule that fails a manifest - it never reports a
distribution absent that some environment does resolve.
