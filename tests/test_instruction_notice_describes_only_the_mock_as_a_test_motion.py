"""The not-read notice describes a policy's actions in that policy's words.

``instruction_not_read_notice`` is the one sentence every task envelope appends
for a policy with ``reads_instruction = False``. It used to spell "Its actions -
a test motion on every joint -" for every such class, which is what
``MockPolicy`` does and what a custom non-reader written from
``docs/policies/custom-policies.md`` does not. The clause now comes from the
class's own ``instruction_free_actions``; a class declaring none gets no clause.
