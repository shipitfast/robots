"""Grade ``strands_robots`` against the layered import DAG.

The package is meant to be readable top to bottom as seven layers, each
importing only downward::

    core -> registry -> drivers|mesh -> sim|policies -> app -> tools -> dashboard

Two properties make that claim checkable, and this script measures both from
the source with :mod:`ast` alone - no import of the package, so a machine
without a vendor SDK or a GPU grades the same graph CI does.

*No cycles.* The import graph is built three ways, because the three kinds of
import fail differently. A **runtime** module-scope import is the one that can
deadlock an interpreter, so its graph must be acyclic. A **typing-only** import
(inside ``if TYPE_CHECKING:``) and a **late** import (inside a function) cost
nothing at import time and are the two sanctioned ways to break a cycle, so
they are reported and excluded from the acyclicity requirement.

*No inversions.* Every edge that points at a higher layer is an inversion, and
direction is graded on two of the three kinds - because direction is a claim
about who depends on whom, which a deferred import does not change: a function
that imports the dashboard on its first call still cannot do its job without
the dashboard. So a runtime inversion is enumerated in
:data:`KNOWN_UPWARD_EDGES` and a deferred one in
:data:`KNOWN_DEFERRED_UPWARD_EDGES`, module pair by module pair. Both rosters
are ratchets: removing an inversion means deleting its line, and adding one
fails the grader until someone writes it down. Typing-only imports are reported
and not graded - an annotation is not a dependency at any point in the run.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_import_layers.py            # report + exit status
    python scripts/check_import_layers.py --verbose  # also list every inversion

#: The package under grading.
PACKAGE = "strands_robots"

#: The layers, lowest first, each naming the top-level members it owns. A
#: module's layer is its first path component under the package, so a subpackage
#: never disagrees with its parent.
#:
#: The placements that are a judgement rather than a reading of the tree:
#: ``assets`` sits with ``registry`` because it resolves the asset paths the
#: registry declares; the five dataset modules sit in ``core`` because a dataset
#: is a contract rather than a host - ``dataset_recorder`` writes one, and
#: reading what it recorded (``dataset_metadata``), resolving the directory a
#: ``repo_id`` names (``dataset_source``), streaming the frames back out
#: (``streaming_dataset``) and uploading the finished directory
#: (``dataset_transfer``) are the other four. The writer is the one that had to
#: be argued: no ``app`` module imports it and none holds a recording session -
#: ``start_recording`` exists only on the three sim backends a layer below -
#: while its own five imports are all ``core``, so keeping it in ``app`` inverted
#: the layering for its only caller and made three core modules look like they
#: had an ``app`` reader when that reader was the recorder. And
#: ``audit`` sits in ``core`` for the same reason the dataset modules do: the
#: append-only safety log is a contract, not a host. It imports nothing from the
#: package at all, and its writers are in three layers - the mesh that names the
#: file, the ``robot_mesh`` tool, and the ``_hitl_audit`` row every
#: human-in-the-loop gate owes - so under ``mesh`` it was a ``core`` module
#: reaching two layers up for a JSONL appender, which is the one inversion this
#: roster carried that nothing forced. And
#: ``teleop_mixin`` sits with ``drivers|mesh`` because it is an input-device
#: concern shared by three hosts in three layers - the hardware ``Robot``, the
#: MuJoCo ``Simulation`` and the Device Connect sim driver - so it belongs under
#: the lowest of them, which is where its own module-scope imports already put
#: it (``utils`` alone). ``teleoperator`` sits there for the same reason and
#: reads the same way: it is the factory for the input device that mixin
#: attaches, its own only in-package import is ``utils``, and its two readers
#: are that mixin and the hardware ``Robot`` a layer above.
#: ``__main__`` sits in the top layer because a console entry point is the one
#: module nothing can import: it is the process, not a part of the library, and
#: it reaches for whatever the command a reader typed needs - the doctor, the
#: dataset verifier, the dashboard CLI. Placing it in ``app``, under ``tools``
#: and ``dashboard``, made every command it dispatches look like an inversion,
#: and the dashboard one had to be declared as such. Named with the top layer
#: rather than given an eighth of its own, the way ``assets`` is named with the
#: ``registry`` it resolves paths for.
