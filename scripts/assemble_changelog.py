"""Assemble ``changelog.d/`` news fragments into ``CHANGELOG.md``.

Why this exists
---------------
Every behavioural PR used to append its entry directly to the top of the
``## [Unreleased]`` section of ``CHANGELOG.md``. Because every branch inserts at
the *same anchor*, any two PRs open at once are guaranteed to conflict the
moment either one merges -- on ordering alone, never on meaning. The repository
dismisses stale approvals on push, so clearing a conflict that is purely an
append-ordering artifact costs a re-approval round on every affected PR, and the
cost scales as O(open PRs). One recorded instance: a single merge to ``main``
turned five already-approved PRs ``CONFLICTING``, with ``CHANGELOG.md`` as the
only conflicting file in all five.

A ``merge=union`` attribute does not fix that: it removes the manual resolution
step, but GitHub's mergeability computation does not apply merge drivers, so the
PR still reports ``CONFLICTING``, the merge button stays disabled, and the
resolving push still dismisses the approval.

A news fragment makes the conflict *structurally impossible*: each PR adds its
own file under ``changelog.d/``, so no two PRs ever touch the same path and
there is nothing for a merge to reconcile. This script is the release-time
assembly step that pays for that: it validates every accumulated fragment and
folds them into the ``[Unreleased]`` section of ``CHANGELOG.md``.

Fragment contract
-----------------
- Path: ``changelog.d/<number>-<slug>.md``, where ``<number>`` is the PR (or
  issue) number and ``<slug>`` is lowercase ``a-z0-9`` words joined by ``-``.
  A placeholder in place of that number -- ``0000-`` or ``999x-`` -- is refused:
  the number is the only pointer from a release-note entry back to the change
  that made it, and ``--apply`` deletes the fragment it folds in, so a
  placeholder that merges makes the entry permanently untraceable. Rename the
  fragment once the number exists.
- Content: exactly the Markdown that would have been pasted into
  ``CHANGELOG.md`` -- one ``### <Category>: <summary>`` heading followed by the
  prose body, in the style of the entries already in the log.
- A fragment may not contain a level-2 (``## ``) heading: that would forge a
  version section and break the structural contract pinned by
  ``tests/test_changelog_format.py``.

Anything else in ``changelog.d/`` (a stray ``.txt``, a misnamed ``.md``) is a
hard error rather than a skipped file -- a fragment that is silently ignored is
a behavioural change that never reaches the log.

Usage
-----
``--check``   validate the fragments and exit non-zero on any problem
              (safe to run in CI; writes nothing).
``--print``   write the assembled ``[Unreleased]`` body to stdout.
``--apply``   fold the fragments into ``CHANGELOG.md`` and delete the consumed
              files. Refuses wholesale if *any* fragment is invalid, leaving
              both the log and the fragments untouched.
